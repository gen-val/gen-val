                    "By season five , her power evolves to enable her to experience aspects of astral projection allowing her to interact with the environment of her premonitions . This aspect of her power is highlighted in the season five episodes `` The Eyes Have It '' and `` Sand Francisco Dreamin ' '' , as well as the season eight episode `` Hulkus Pocus '' . Her premonition powers also evolve to allow Phoebe to anticipate the actions of others as in many instances Phoebe has sidestepped and jumped out the way of incoming fireballs and energy balls with perfect timing . Examples of this can be seen in the season seven episodes `` Freaky Phoebe '' , where Phoebe is able to sense a demon who is behind her with a pair of scissors , and in the episode `` Ordinary Witches '' , where Ronnie ( Brian Howe ) , a cab driver Phoebe loses her powers to , is able to sense when and where the next fireball of a demon is going to be launched using her power of premonitions . Phoebe also develops the power to trigger a vision in someone else with similar powers , `` sharing '' visions with Elders and knowing how to trigger a specific `` trap '' premonition in the evil witch Mitzy ( Jenny McCarthy ) , who has temporary possession of her powers . Kyra ( Charisma Carpenter ) , a powerful demonic seer , tells Phoebe her powers were once limited to psychometry but they grew , like Phoebe 's will in time . At the start of season three , in the episode `` The Honeymoon 's Over '' , Phoebe obtains her first active power in the form of levitation , the power to defy gravity and float in the air . This power is uncontrollable when she first obtains it , but she later learns to maintain complete control over it . When new to her power , Phoebe is unable to move horizontally , and in the season three episode `` Once Upon a Time '' , Prue uses telekinesis to guide Phoebe across a cavern while she is levitating . Later in the series , Phoebe often mixes her martial arts and kick boxing with her levitating power to knock out her enemies . In season four , the power advances so that Phoebe is able to glide short distances while levitating and she even learns to use her power to walk on walls . During the fifth season , she is able to propel herself while levitating , as seen when she propels herself through a ventilation duct with her levitation powers in the episode `` The Importance of Being Phoebe '' . In the season six episode `` Forget Me ... Not '' , Phoebe showcases a form of projective levitation , when she levitates herself and a weatherman . Phoebe displays projective levitation again in the episode `` Love 's a Witch '' when she levitates the pillow she is sitting on along with her . In the Charmed comic books , specifically in issue # 16 `` The Heavens Can Wait '' , her power has been shown to have grown stronger , allowing Phoebe to levitate Paige 's orb - shield which contained herself , her two sisters and Leo . While inside the Nexus of The All , Phoebe became able to use her power to its full potential , allowing her to not only fly but also to carry Piper and Paige with ease . Later , Prue tells Phoebe that her power will advance to this stage naturally at some point in the future ."

                    "The Salton Sea is a shallow , saline , endorheic rift lake located directly on the San Andreas Fault , predominantly in California 's Imperial and Coachella Valleys . The lake occupies the lowest elevations of the Salton Sink in the Colorado Desert of Imperial and Riverside Counties in Southern California . Its surface is 235.2 ft ( 71.7 m ) below sea level as of Feb. 5 , 2017 . The deepest point of the sea is 5 ft ( 1.5 m ) higher than the lowest point of Death Valley . The sea is fed by the New , Whitewater , and Alamo Rivers , as well as agricultural runoff , drainage systems , and creeks . Over millions of years , the Colorado River has flowed into the Imperial Valley and deposited soil ( creating fertile farmland ) , building up the terrain and constantly changing the course of the river . For thousands of years , the river has flowed into and out of the valley alternately , creating a freshwater lake , an increasingly saline lake , and a dry desert basin , depending on river flows and the balance between inflow and evaporative loss . The cycle of filling has been about every 400 -- 500 years and has repeated itself many times . The latest natural cycle occurred around 1600 -- 1700 as remembered by Native Americans who talked with the first European settlers . Fish traps still exist at many locations , and the Native Americans evidently moved the traps depending upon the cycle ."

                    "Grape varieties in South Africa are known as cultivar , with many common international varieties developing local synonyms that still have a strong tradition of use . These include : Chenin blanc ( Steen ) , Riesling ( until recently known locally as Weisser Riesling ) , Crouchen ( known as Cape Riesling ) , Palomino ( the grape of the Spanish wine Sherry known locally as `` White French '' ) , Trebbiano ( Ugni Blanc ) , S\u00e9millon ( Groendruif ) and Muscat of Alexandria ( Hanepoot ) . However , wines that are often exported overseas will usually have the more internationally recognised name appear on the wine label . In 2015 , SAWIS ( South African Wine Information and Systems ) reported that the country had 100,146 hectares of vineyards , with about 55 % planted with white varieties . Chenin blanc has long been the most widely planted variety , still accounting for over 18 % of all grape area planted in South Africa as of 2015 , though it is slowly decreasing in overall share of vineyard area . In the 1980s and 1990s , interest in international varieties saw increase in plantings of Chardonnay and Sauvignon blanc . Other white grape varieties with significant plantings include Colombard ( also spelled locally as Colombar ) , Cape Riesling , Gew\u00fcrztraminer , Hanepoot , Muscat Blanc \u00e0 Petits Grains , Riesling and S\u00e9millon . Both red and white mutants of Muscat Blanc \u00e0 Petits Grains as well as Chenel and Weldra , two Chenin blanc - Ugni blanc crossings , are used for brandy distillation and fortified wine production . From the 1990s , plantings of red grape varieties rose steadily . In the late 1990s , less than 18 % of all the grapes grown in South Africa were red . By 2009 that number had risen to 44 % . For most of the 20th century , the high yielding Cinsaut was the most widely planted red grape variety , but the shift in focus to quality wine production has seen plantings of the grape steadily decline to where it represented just 2 % of all South Africa vineyards in 2009 . In its place , Cabernet Sauvignon , Shiraz and Pinotage have risen to prominence with Cabernet Sauvignon being the most widely grown red grape variety covering 12 % of all plantings in 2009 . Other red grape varieties found in South Africa include : Carignan , Gamay ( often made in the style of Beaujolais wine with carbonic maceration ) , Grenache , Petit Verdot , Cabernet Franc , Pontac , Ruby Cabernet , Tinta Barroca and Zinfandel ."

In the context of the stage musical , the song is sung by Samuel Pickwick , when he is mistaken for an election candidate and called on by the crowd to give his manifesto . Ornadel and Bricusse received the 1963 Ivor Novello award for Best Song Musically and Lyrically . The song is usually associated with Sir Harry Secombe , who got the song to No 18 in the UK charts in 1963 , but has been performed by other singers , notably Tony Bennett , Robert Goulet , James Brown , Stevie Wonder , The Supremes , Tom Jones and Regina Belle . Tony Bennett originally recorded the song in 1965 , and had a number 34 hit with it on the U.S. pop singles charts . With Celine Dion , he returned to the song on his Grammy - winning 2006 album Duets : An American Classic ."

                    "The United States presidential election of 1896 was the 28th quadrennial presidential election , held on Tuesday , November 3 , 1896 . Former Governor William McKinley , the Republican candidate , defeated Democrat William Jennings Bryan . The 1896 campaign , which took place during an economic depression known as the Panic of 1893 , was a realigning election that ended the old Third Party System and began the Fourth Party System . Incumbent Democratic President Grover Cleveland did not seek for reelection for a second ( or third non-consecutive ) term , leaving the Democratic nomination open . Bryan , an attorney and former Congressman , galvanized support with his Cross of Gold speech , which called for a reform of the monetary system and attacked business leaders as the cause of ongoing economic depression . The 1896 Democratic National Convention repudiated the Cleveland administration and nominated Bryan on the fifth presidential ballot . Bryan then won the nomination of the Populist Party , which had won several states in 1892 and shared many of Bryan 's policies . In opposition to Bryan , some conservative Bourbon Democrats formed the National Democratic Party and nominated Senator John M. Palmer . McKinley prevailed by a wide margin on the first ballot of the 1896 Republican National Convention ."

Because these people were lighter skinned , they were seen as more European and therefore as candidates for civilization . At the same time , because they were occupying the land desired by the colonial powers , they were from the beginning , targets of potential military attack . At first , indentured servants were used as the needed labor . These servants provided up to seven years of service in exchange for having their trip to Jamestown paid for by someone in Jamestown . Once the seven years was over , the indentured servant was free to live in Jamestown as a regular citizen . However , colonists began to see indentured servants as too costly , in part because the high mortality rate meant the force had to be resupplied . In 1619 , Dutch traders brought African slaves taken from a Spanish ship to Jamestown ; in North America , the Africans were also generally treated as indentured servants in the early colonial era . Several colonial colleges held enslaved people as workers and relied on them to operate ."

                    "A yahrzeit candle , also spelled yahrtzeit candle or called a memorial candle , ( Hebrew : \u05e0\u05e8 \u05e0\u05e9\u05de\u05d4 \u200e , ner neshama , meaning `` soul candle '' ; Yiddish : \u05d9\u05d0\u05b8\u05e8\u05e6\u05f2\u05b7\u05d8 \u05dc\u05d9\u05db\u05d8 \u200e yortsayt likht , meaning `` anniversary candle '' ) is a type of candle that is lit in memory of the dead in Judaism . This kind of candle , that burns up to 26 hours , is also lit on the eve of Yom Kippur or of the Holocaust Remembrance Day ceremony ( Yom HaShoah ) to burn through the entire occasion . ( Judaism reckons `` days '' to begin at sundown , in accordance with Genesis , e.g. , 1 : 5 : `` And there was evening and there was morning , one day . '' ) The use of a yahrzeit candle is a widely practiced custom , where mourners light a yahrzeit candle that burns for 24 hours , on the anniversary of the death on the Hebrew calendar . The word `` yahrzeit '' ( Yiddish : \u05d9\u05d0\u05b8\u05e8\u05e6\u05f2\u05b7\u05d8 \u200e yortsayt ) itself means `` anniversary '' ( or more specifically `` anniversary ( of a person 's death ) '' ) in Yiddish , originating from German Jahr , year , and Zeit , time . It is customary to light the candle inside one 's home , or near the grave of the deceased . The candle is also lit on Yom Kippur and there are also customs to light a yahrzeit candle on the dates when yizkor is said ( Yom Kippur , Shemini Atzeret , final day of Pesach , and Shavuot ) . It is also customary to light the candle during the shiva , usually a larger one that lasts the entire seven days . The custom of lighting a yahrzeit candle comes from the Book of Proverbs 20 : 27 `` The soul of man is a candle of the Lord . ''"

                    "The Coens used digital color correction to give the film a sepia - tinted look . Joel stated this was because the actual set was `` greener than Ireland . '' Cinematographer Roger Deakins stated , `` Ethan and Joel favored a dry , dusty Delta look with golden sunsets . They wanted it to look like an old hand - tinted picture , with the intensity of colors dictated by the scene and natural skin tones that were all shades of the rainbow . '' Initially the crew tried to perform the color correction using a physical process , however after several tries with various chemical processes proved unsatisfactory , it became necessary to perform the process digitally . This was the fifth film collaboration between the Coen Brothers and Deakins , and it was slated to be shot in Mississippi at a time of year when the foliage , grass , trees , and bushes would be a lush green . It was filmed near locations in Canton , Mississippi and Florence , South Carolina in the summer of 1999 . After shooting tests , including film bipack and bleach bypass techniques , Deakins suggested digital mastering be used . Deakins subsequently spent 11 weeks fine - tuning the look , mainly targeting the greens , making them a burnt yellow and desaturating the overall image in the digital files . This made it the first feature film to be entirely color corrected by digital means , narrowly beating Nick Park 's Chicken Run . O Brother , Where Art Thou ? was the first time a digital intermediate was used on the entirety of a first - run Hollywood film that otherwise had very few visual effects . The work was done in Los Angeles by Cinesite using a Spirit DataCine for scanning at 2K resolution , a Pandora MegaDef to adjust the color , and a Kodak Lightning II recorder to put out to film ."

The song was nominated for Best Original Song at the 69th Academy Awards as well as Best Original Song at the 54th Golden Globe Awards , losing out on both occasions to Madonna 's `` You Must Love Me '' ( written by Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber ) from the musical Evita . On April 25 , 2017 , three quarters of the actors who played The Wonders - Tom Everett Scott ( Guy `` Shades '' Patterson ) , Johnathon Schaech ( Jimmy Mattingly II ) and Ethan Embry ( `` T.B. Player '' ) - performed the song live during a surprise appearance at the Roxy in Los Angeles . The occasion was the Goddamn Comedy Jam , a live show series in which comedians tell funny stories about a meaningful song and then perform it with a live band . Comedian and show creator Josh Adam Meyers persuaded the actors to perform the song with him . After initial hesitation on Scott 's part , Meyers managed to persuade him with help from The After Jam producer Jason Gallagher , who happened to be Scott 's brother - in - law . The other actors soon followed suit , with Gallagher helping them learn how to play the instruments . Steve Zahn ( Lenny Haise ) was unable to participate due to living in Kentucky ; comedian Jeremiah Watkins took his place on lead guitar while wearing a cut - out mask of Zahn 's face . On April 10 , 2017 , Embry posted a video of himself playing the song 's bass line ; it is now apparent that the video was a teaser for the event two weeks later . Coincidentally , Tom Everett Scott replaced Steve Zahn as Frank Heffley in the Diary of a Wimpy Kid film series ."

The two sets of lyrics share little but the common refrain of `` I wo n't dance '' . The second set of lyrics is the much better known one , and the song in this form has been covered by many artists . Kern , Hammerstein and Harbach originally wrote `` I Wo n't Dance '' for the 1934 London musical Three Sisters . However , Three Sisters flopped and was quickly forgotten ."

First published in Gospel Songs No. 2 by Sankey and Bliss ( 1876 ) , it is possibly the most influential and enduring in the Bliss repertoire and is often taken as a choral model , appearing in hymnals of a wide variety of Christian fellowships . This hymn was written after traumatic events in Spafford 's life . The first was the death of his son at the age of 2 and the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 , which ruined him financially ( he had been a successful lawyer and had invested significantly in property in the area of Chicago that was extensively damaged by the great fire ) . His business interests were further hit by the economic downturn of 1873 , at which time he had planned to travel to Europe with his family on the SS Ville du Havre . In a late change of plan , he sent the family ahead while he was delayed on business concerning zoning problems following the Great Chicago Fire . While crossing the Atlantic , the ship sank rapidly after a collision with a sea vessel , the Loch Earn , and all four of Spafford 's daughters died . His wife Anna survived and sent him the now famous telegram , `` Saved alone ... '' . Shortly afterwards , as Spafford traveled to meet his grieving wife , he was inspired to write these words as his ship passed near where his daughters had died ."

Other notable Indian athletes also included world 's top - ranked tennis player Sania Mirza in the women 's doubles , artistic gymnast and Commonwealth Games bronze medalist Dipa Karmakar , and multiple - time world medalist Jitu Rai in men 's pistol shooting . India left Rio de Janeiro with only two medals , saving its pride from the humiliation of returning empty - handed for the first time since Barcelona 1992 . These medals were awarded only to female athletes for the first time in history , a silver to badminton player P.V. Sindhu in the women 's singles , and a bronze to freestyle wrestler Sakshi Malik in the women 's 58 kg . Several Indian athletes came close to increasing the medal haul , including tennis tandem Mirza and Rohan Bopanna in the mixed doubles ; Bindra , who narrowly missed out the podium by a half - point in the men 's 10 m air rifle before retiring from the sport ; and Karmakar , who surprised the global audience with her high - risk Produnova routine in the women 's vault . For the first time , the Indian shooters failed to earn a single medal since 2000 , and the boxers for the first time since 2004 ."

                    "Such depositions in tissues often induce an inflammatory response , and can cause damage wherever they precipitate . The cause of damage is as a result of the action of cleaved complement anaphylotoxins C3a and C5a , which , respectively , mediate the induction of granule release from mast cells ( from which histamine can cause urticaria ) , and recruitment of inflammatory cells into the tissue ( mainly those with lysosomal action , leading to tissue damage through frustrated phagocytosis by PMNs and macrophages ) . The reaction can take hours , days , or even weeks to develop , depending on whether or not there is immunological memory of the precipitating antigen . Typically , clinical features emerge a week following initial antigen challenge , when the deposited immune complexes can precipitate an inflammatory response . Because of the nature of the antibody aggregation , tissues that are associated with blood filtration at considerable osmotic and hydrostatic gradient ( e.g. sites of urinary and synovial fluid formation , kidney glomeruli and joint tissues respectively ) bear the brunt of the damage . Hence , vasculitis , glomerulonephritis and arthritis are commonly associated conditions as a result of type III hypersensitivity responses . As observed under methods of histopathology , acute necrotizing vasculitis within the affected tissues is observed concomitant to neutrophilic infiltration , along with notable eosinophilic deposition ( fibrinoid necrosis ) . Often , immunofluorescence microscopy can be used to visualize the immune complexes . Skin response to a hypersensitivity of this type is referred to as an Arthus reaction , and is characterized by local erythema and some induration . Platelet aggregation , especially in microvasculature , can cause localized clot formation , leading to blotchy hemorrhages . This typifies the response to injection of foreign antigen sufficient to lead to the condition of serum sickness ."

Pulled pork is found around the world in a variety of forms . Pulled pork , usually shoulder cut ( sometimes referred to as mixed cuts ) , is commonly slow - cooked by a smoking method , though a non-barbecue method might also be employed using a slow cooker or a domestic oven . In rural areas across the United States , either a pig roast / whole hog , mixed cuts of the pig / hog , or the shoulder cut ( Boston Butt ) alone are commonly used , and the pork is served with or without a vinegar - based sauce . Before cooking , it is common to soak the meat in brine ; it provides the extra moisture needed for a long , slow cooking process ."

'' Jordan was one of the most effectively marketed athletes of his generation and was considered instrumental in popularizing the NBA around the world in the 1980s and 1990s . He is currently the principal owner and chairman of the NBA 's Charlotte Hornets . Jordan played three seasons for coach Dean Smith at the University of North Carolina .

He quickly emerged as a league star and entertained crowds with his prolific scoring . His leaping ability , demonstrated by performing slam dunks from the free throw line in slam dunk contests , earned him the nicknames Air Jordan and His Airness . He also gained a reputation for being one of the best defensive players in basketball . In 1991 , he won his first NBA championship with the Bulls , and followed that achievement with titles in 1992 and 1993 , securing a `` three - peat '' . Although Jordan abruptly retired from basketball before the beginning of the 1993 -- 94 NBA season and started a new career playing minor league baseball , he returned to the Bulls in March 1995 and led them to three additional championships in 1996 , 1997 , and 1998 , as well as a then - record 72 regular - season wins in the 1995 -- 96 NBA season . Jordan retired for a second time in January 1999 , but returned for two more NBA seasons from 2001 to 2003 as a member of the Wizards .

In 1999 , he was named the greatest North American athlete of the 20th century by ESPN , and was second to Babe Ruth on the Associated Press 's list of athletes of the century . Jordan is a two - time inductee into the Basketball Hall of Fame , having been enshrined in 2009 for his individual career , and again in 2010 as part of the group induction of the 1992 United States men 's Olympic basketball team ( `` The Dream Team '' ) .

The United States Declaration of Independence was drafted by Thomas Jefferson , and then edited by the Committee of Five , which consisted of Jefferson , John Adams , Benjamin Franklin , Roger Sherman , and Robert Livingston . It was then further edited and adopted by the Committee of the Whole of the Second Continental Congress on July 4 , 1776 . The second paragraph of the first article in the Declaration of Independence contains the phrase `` Life , Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness '' .

                    "Roman law moved toward monetary compensation as a substitute for vengeance . In cases of assault , fixed penalties were set for various injuries , although talio was still permitted if one person broke another 's limb . The principle was first referenced in the Code of Hammurabi , which predates the Hebrew bible . In the Hebrew Law , the `` eye for eye '' was to restrict compensation to the value of the loss . Thus , it might be better read ' only one eye for one eye ' . The idiomatic biblical phrase `` an eye for an eye '' in Exodus and Leviticus ( \u05e2\u05d9\u05df \u05ea\u05d7\u05ea \u05e2\u05d9\u05df \u202c , ayin tachat ayin ) literally means ' an eye under / ( in place of ) an eye ' while a slightly different phrase ( \u05e2\u05b7\u05d9\u05b4\u05df \u05d1\u05b0\u05bc\u05e2\u05b7\u05d9\u05b4\u05df \u05e9\u05b5\u05c1\u05df \u05d1\u05b0\u05bc\u05e9\u05b5\u05c1\u05df , literally `` eye for an eye ; tooth for a tooth '' ) is used in another passage ( Deuteronomy ) in the context of possible reciprocal court sentences for failed false witnesses . The passage in Leviticus states , `` And a man who injures his countryman -- as he has done , so it shall be done to him ( namely , ) fracture under / for fracture , eye under / for eye , tooth under / for tooth . Just as another person has received injury from him , so it will be given to him . '' ( Lev. 24 : 19 -- 21 ) . For an example of \u05ea\u05d7\u05ea \u202c being used in its regular sense of under , see Lev. 22 : 27 `` A bull , sheep or goat , when it is born shall remain under its mother , and from the eighth day ... '' Isaac Kalimi explains that the `` lex talionis was humanized by the Rabbis who interpreted `` an eye for an eye '' to mean reasonable pecuniary compensation . As in the case of the Babylonian ' lex talionis ' , ethical Judaism and humane Jewish jurisprudence replaces the peshat ( literal meaning ) of the written Torah . Pasachoff and Littman point to the reinterpretation of the lex talionis as an example of the ability of Pharisaic Judaism to `` adapt to changing social and intellectual ideas . ''"

                    "In 2003 , over four - fifths ( 85 percent ) of all adults 25 years or older reported they had completed at least high school , or obtained a GED / high school equivalency certificate . Over one in four adults ( 27 percent ) had attained at least a bachelor 's degree . Both of these measures are all time highs . In 2003 , the percentage of the adult population who had completed high school or had not completed high school but obtained a GED increased for the first time since 2000 , when it was 84 percent . This increase follows a general trend that the Current Population Survey has shown since educational attainment was first measured in 1947 . In 2015 , among adults aged 65 and older , 84 percent had either completed high school or more education , or had failed to complete high school but obtained at least a GED certification , compared to 91 percent of adults aged 25 to 34 and 89 percent of adults aged 35 to 44 years or 45 to 64 years . In addition , 27 percent of the population aged 65 and older reported a bachelor 's degree or more education compared to 36 percent of adults 25 to 34 years old and 32 percent of adults aged 45 to 64 years . Since 1983 the percentage of people either graduating from high school or failing to complete high school but getting a GED certification has increased from 85 % to 88 % . The greatest increases in educational attainment were documented in the 1950s , 60s and 70s . In the 1950s and much of the 1960s high school graduates constituted about 50 % of those considered adults ( 25 and above ) . For young adults aged between 25 and 29 , the percentage of either high school graduates or GED obtainers was roughly 50 % in 1950 versus 90 % today ."

                    "A candy cane is a cane - shaped stick candy often associated with Christmastide , as well as Saint Nicholas Day . It is traditionally white with red stripes and flavored with peppermint , but may also be a variety of other flavors and colors . According to folklore , in 1670 , in Cologne , Germany , the choirmaster at Cologne Cathedral , wishing to remedy the noise caused by children in his church during the Living Cr\u00e8che tradition of Christmas Eve , asked a local candy maker for some `` sugar sticks '' for them . In order to justify the practice of giving candy to children during worship services , he asked the candy maker to add a crook to the top of each stick , which would help children remember the shepherds who visited the infant Jesus . In addition , he used the white colour of the converted sticks to teach children about the Christian belief in the sinless life of Jesus . From Germany , candy canes spread to other parts of Europe , where they were handed out during plays reenacting the Nativity . As such , according to this legend , the candy cane became associated with Christmastide . The earliest verifiable reference to stick candy is a record of the 1837 Exhibition of the Massachusetts Charitable Mechanic Association , where confections were judged competitively . A recipe for straight peppermint candy sticks , white with coloured stripes , was published in 1844 . The `` candy cane '' is found in literature in 1866 , though no description of color or flavor was provided . Its earliest known association with Christmas was in 1874 , and by 1882 canes were being hung on Christmas trees ."

The plantar fascia is a broad structure that spans between the medial calcaneal tubercle and the proximal phalanges of the toes . Recent studies suggest that the plantar fascia is actually an aponeurosis rather than true fascia . The Dorland 's Medical Dictionary defines an aponeurosis as : ( i ) a white , flattened or ribbon - like tendinous expansion , serving mainly to connect a muscle with the parts that it moves , ( ii ) a term formerly applied to certain fasciae . Further , it defines the plantar aponeurosis as bands of fibrous connective tissue radiating toward the bases of the toes from the medial process of the tuber calcanei ( posterior half of the calcaneus ) ."

It was Peck 's final theatrical film .

Cape Fear marks the seventh collaboration between Scorsese and De Niro . The film received positive reviews and received Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations for Best Actor ( De Niro ) and Best Supporting Actress ( Lewis ) ."

The game was played between the winners of two pre-designated semifinal bowls played on December 31 , 2015 : the No. 1 Clemson Tigers , who beat the No. 4 Oklahoma Sooners 37 -- 17 at the Orange Bowl , coached by Dabo Swinney in his 8th season , and the No. 2 Alabama Crimson Tide , who shut out the No. 3 Michigan State Spartans 38 -- 0 at the Cotton Bowl Classic , coached by Nick Saban . The 13 -- 1 Alabama Crimson Tide won the game , holding off the undefeated Clemson Tigers 45 -- 40 in the fourth quarter . Accompanied by a talented receiving corps , Clemson 's Heisman Finalist quarterback Deshaun Watson had a historic performance , setting the record for most total yards in national championship game history , with 478 yards ( 405 passing / 73 rushing ) against the nation 's third - ranked defense in Alabama , breaking the record previously set by Vince Young in the 2006 Rose Bowl .

                    "In the Roman Kingdom and the early Roman Republic the most important division in Roman society was between the patricians and the plebeians . The patricians were a small elite whose ancestry was traced to the first Senate established by Romulus , who monopolised political power . The plebeians comprised the majority of Roman citizens ( see below ) . Adult males who were not Roman citizens , whether free or slave , fall outside this division . Women and children were also not citizens , but took the social status of their father or husband , which granted them various rights and protections not available to the women and children of men of lower rank . The common assumptions that the patricians and the Roman elite were one and the same throughout the history of ancient Rome , and that all plebeians were of non-elite status throughout the history of ancient Rome , are entirely incorrect . From the Late Republic era onward many members of the elite , including an increasing proportion of senators , came from plebeian families . The first Roman Emperor , Augustus , was of plebeian origin , as were many of his successors . By the Late Empire , few members of the Senate were from the original patrician families , most of which had died out . Rome continued to have a hierarchical class system , but it was no longer dominated by the distinction between patricians and plebeians ."

                    "Rheumatic fever ( RF ) is an inflammatory disease that can involve the heart , joints , skin , and brain . The disease typically develops two to four weeks after a streptococcal throat infection . Signs and symptoms include fever , multiple painful joints , involuntary muscle movements , and occasionally a characteristic non-itchy rash known as erythema marginatum . The heart is involved in about half of cases . Damage to the heart valves , known as rheumatic heart disease ( RHD ) , usually occurs after repeated attacks but can sometimes occur after one . The damaged valves may result in heart failure , atrial fibrillation and infection of the valves . Rheumatic fever may occur following an infection of the throat by the bacterium Streptococcus pyogenes . If the infection is untreated rheumatic fever can occur in up to three percent of people . The underlying mechanism is believed to involve the production of antibodies against a person 's own tissues . Due to their genetics , some people are more likely to get the disease when exposed to the bacteria than others . Other risk factors include malnutrition and poverty . Diagnosis of RF is often based on the presence of signs and symptoms in combination with evidence of a recent streptococcal infection . Treating people who have strep throat with antibiotics , such as penicillin , decreases the risk of developing rheumatic fever . In order to avoid antibiotic misuse this often involves testing people with sore throats for the infection , which may not be available in the developing world . Other preventive measures include improved sanitation . In those with rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease , prolonged periods of antibiotics are sometimes recommended . Gradual return to normal activities may occur following an attack . Once RHD develops , treatment is more difficult . Occasionally valve replacement surgery or valve repair is required . Otherwise complications are treated as per normal ."

It also appears as the opening track on the American version of their album Between the Buttons . It has been covered by various artists , including David Bowie in 1973 . The song was recorded in December 1966 at the RCA Records studio in Hollywood , California , where the group recorded most of their 1965 -- 1966 hits . Recording engineer Glyn Johns recounts that while mixing `` Let 's Spend the Night Together '' , Oldham was trying to get a certain sound by clicking his fingers . Two policemen showed up , stating that the front door was open and that they were checking to see if everything was all right . At first , Oldham asked them to hold his earphones while he snapped his fingers but then Johns said they needed a more wooden sound . The policemen suggested their truncheons and Mick Jagger took the truncheons into the studio to record the claves - like sound that can be heard during the quiet break at one minute 40 seconds into the song ."

                    "In the 2013 theatrical feature film of The Lone Ranger , Tonto is depicted as a Comanche tribesman . Tonto first rode a horse named `` White Feller '' ( White Fella / Fellah ) . When the 1938 Republic movie serial The Lone Ranger was being filmed , it was thought that having two white horses would be confusing , so the producers made `` White Feller '' a pinto horse , presumably on the theory that , being partly white , a pinto could still be named `` White Feller '' . The radio series , noting that the pinto in the film had gone over well with audiences , decided that Tonto 's mount would henceforth be a pinto . For several episodes , Tonto 's new horse went unnamed , referred to only as `` the paint horse '' or simply `` Paint '' . Eventually the name `` Scout '' was adopted . The portrayal of Tonto has been seen by some Native Americans and others as degrading , notably by Native American author and poet Sherman Alexie . Tonto spoke in a pidgin , saying things like , `` That right , Kemo Sabe '' , or `` Him say man ride over ridge on horse '' ."

                    "A thermal power station is a power plant in which heat energy is converted to electric power . In most of the places in the world the turbine is steam - driven . Water is heated , turns into steam and spins a steam turbine which drives an electrical generator . After it passes through the turbine , the steam is condensed in a condenser and recycled to where it was heated ; this is known as a Rankine cycle . The greatest variation in the design of thermal power stations is due to the different heat sources ; fossil fuel dominates here , although nuclear heat energy and solar heat energy are also used . Some prefer to use the term energy center because such facilities convert forms of heat energy into electrical energy . Certain thermal power plants also are designed to produce heat energy for industrial purposes , or district heating , or desalination of water , in addition to generating electrical power . Almost all coal , nuclear , geothermal , solar thermal electric , and waste incineration plants , as well as many natural gas power plants are thermal . Natural gas is frequently combusted in gas turbines as well as boilers . The waste heat from a gas turbine , in the form of hot exhaust gas , can be used to raise steam , by passing this gas through a Heat Recovery Steam Generator ( HRSG ) the steam is then used to drive a steam turbine in a combined cycle plant that improves overall efficiency . Power plants burning coal , fuel oil , or natural gas are often called fossil - fuel power plants . Some biomass - fueled thermal power plants have appeared also . Non-nuclear thermal power plants , particularly fossil - fueled plants , which do not use co-generation are sometimes referred to as conventional power plants ."

                    "As of 2014 in Nigeria , the HIV prevalence rate among adults ages 15 -- 49 was 3.17 percent . Nigeria has the second - largest number of people living with HIV . The HIV epidemic in Nigeria is complex and varies widely by region . In some states , the epidemic is more concentrated and driven by high - risk behaviors , while other states have more generalized epidemics that are sustained primarily by multiple sexual partnerships in the general population . Youth and young adults in Nigeria are particularly vulnerable to HIV , with young women at higher risk than young men . There are many risk factors that contribute to the spread of HIV , including prostitution , high - risk practices among itinerant workers , high prevalence of sexually transmitted infections ( STI ) , clandestine high - risk heterosexual and homosexual practices , international trafficking of women , and irregular blood screening . Nigeria is emerging from a period of military rule that accounted for almost 28 of the 57 years since independence in 1960 . Consequently , the policy environment is not fully democratized . Civil society was weak during the military era , and its role in advocacy and lobbying remains weak . The size of the population and the nation pose logistical and political challenges particularly due to the political determination of the Nigerian government to achieve health care equity across geopolitical zones . The necessity to coordinate programs simultaneously at the federal , state and local levels introduces complexity into planning . The large private sector is largely unregulated and , more importantly , has no formal connection to the public health system where most HIV interventions are delivered . Training and human resource development is severely limited in all sectors and will hamper program implementation at all levels . Care and support is limited because existing staff are overstretched and most have insufficient training in key technical areas to provide complete HIV services ."

                    "The play , set in Verona , Italy , begins with a street brawl between Montague and Capulet servants who , like their masters , are sworn enemies . Prince Escalus of Verona intervenes and declares that further breach of the peace will be punishable by death . Later , Count Paris talks to Capulet about marrying his daughter Juliet , but Capulet asks Paris to wait another two years and invites him to attend a planned Capulet ball . Lady Capulet and Juliet 's nurse try to persuade Juliet to accept Paris 's courtship . Meanwhile , Benvolio talks with his cousin Romeo , Montague 's son , about Romeo 's recent depression . Benvolio discovers that it stems from unrequited infatuation for a girl named Rosaline , one of Capulet 's nieces . Persuaded by Benvolio and Mercutio , Romeo attends the ball at the Capulet house in hopes of meeting Rosaline . However , Romeo instead meets and falls in love with Juliet . Juliet 's cousin , Tybalt , is enraged at Romeo for sneaking into the ball but is only stopped from killing Romeo by Juliet 's father , who does not wish to shed blood in his house . After the ball , in what is now called the `` balcony scene '' , Romeo sneaks into the Capulet orchard and overhears Juliet at her window vowing her love to him in spite of her family 's hatred of the Montagues . Romeo makes himself known to her and they agree to be married . With the help of Friar Laurence , who hopes to reconcile the two families through their children 's union , they are secretly married the next day ."

'' Later in life Walter was a philanthropist , a board member of the WNET public television station in New York and an early and long - time supporter of the Charlie Rose interview show . Rosie the Riveter became most closely associated with another real woman , Rose Will Monroe , who was born in Pulaski County , Kentucky in 1920 and moved to Michigan during World War II . She worked as a riveter at the Willow Run Aircraft Factory in Ypsilanti , Michigan , building B - 24 bombers for the U.S. Army Air Forces . Monroe was asked to star in a promotional film about the war effort at home . The song `` Rosie the Riveter '' was popular at the time , and Monroe happened to best fit the description of the worker depicted in the song . `` Rosie '' went on to become perhaps the most widely recognized icon of that era . The films and posters she appeared in were used to encourage women to go to work in support of the war effort . At the age of 50 , Monroe realized her dream of flying when she obtained a pilot 's license . In 1978 , she crashed in her small propeller plane when the engine failed during takeoff . The accident resulted in the loss of one kidney and the sight in her left eye , and ended her flying career . She died from kidney failure on May 31 , 1997 , in Clarksville , Indiana where she was a resident , at the age of 77 . A drama film , Rosie the Riveter , was released in 1944 , borrowing from the Rosie theme ."

Cadaveric spasm can be distinguished from rigor mortis being stronger stiffening of the muscles that ca n't be easily undone like rigor mortis . The cause is unknown , but is usually associated with violent deaths happening under extremely physical circumstances with intense emotion . Cadaveric spasm may affect all muscles in the body , but typically only groups , such as the forearms , or hands . Cadaveric spasm is seen in cases of drowning victims when grass , weeds , roots or other materials are clutched , and provides evidence of life at the time of entry into the water . Cadaveric spasm often crystallizes the last activity one did before death and is therefore significant in forensic investigations , e.g. holding onto a knife tightly ."

                    "The best - known triangular trading system is the transatlantic slave trade , that operated from the late 16th to early 19th centuries , carrying slaves , cash crops , and manufactured goods between West Africa , Caribbean or American colonies and the European colonial powers , with the northern colonies of British North America , especially New England , sometimes taking over the role of Europe . The use of African slaves was fundamental to growing colonial cash crops , which were exported to Europe . European goods , in turn , were used to purchase African slaves , who were then brought on the sea lane west from Africa to the Americas , the so - called Middle Passage . Despite being driven primarily by economic needs , Europeans sometimes had a religious justification for their actions . In 1452 , for instance , Pope Nicholas V , in the Dum Diversas , granted to the kings of Spain and Portugal `` full and free permission to invade , search out , capture , and subjugate the Saracens ( Muslims ) and pagans and any other unbelievers ... and to reduce their persons into perpetual slavery . '' A classic example is the colonial molasses trade . Sugar ( often in its liquid form , molasses ) from the Caribbean was traded to Europe or New England , where it was distilled into rum . The profits from the sale of sugar were used to purchase manufactured goods , which were then shipped to West Africa , where they were bartered for slaves . The slaves were then brought back to the Caribbean to be sold to sugar planters . The profits from the sale of the slaves were then used to buy more sugar , which was shipped to Europe , restarting the cycle . The trip itself took five to twelve weeks ."

Indeed , the epic form prevailed and verse remained until very recently the preferred form of Hindu literary works . Hero - worship was and is a central aspect of Indian culture , and thus readily lent itself to a literary tradition that abounded in epic poetry and literature . The Puranas , a massive collection of verse - form histories of India 's many Hindu gods and goddesses , followed in this tradition .

The test is based on the presence of specific IgM and IgG antibodies to a specific 50 Kd OMP antigen , which is impregnated on nitrocellulose strips . IgM shows recent infection whereas IgG signifies remote infection . The most important limitation of this test is that it is not quantitative and result is only positive or negative .

The two bombings killed at least 129,000 people ( most of whom were civilians ) and remain the only use of nuclear weapons in the history of warfare . In the final year of the war , the Allies prepared for what was anticipated to be a very costly invasion of the Japanese mainland . This undertaking was preceded by a U.S. conventional and firebombing campaign that destroyed 67 Japanese cities . The war in Europe had concluded when Germany signed its instrument of surrender on May 8 , 1945 , which was eight days after Adolf Hitler committed suicide . The Japanese were facing the same fate but refused to accept the Allies ' demands for unconditional surrender , and the war in the Pacific Theatre continued . The Allies called for the unconditional surrender of the Imperial Japanese armed forces in the Potsdam Declaration on July 26 , 1945 -- the alternative being `` prompt and utter destruction '' . The Japanese ignored the ultimatum and the war continued ."

Though nothing can be done at the moment ( it being winter ) , they resolve that when the time is right they will make a plan to protect Toad from himself ; they are , after all , his friends , and are worried about his well - being . With the arrival of summer , Badger visits Mole and Rat to take action over Toad 's self - destructive obsession . The three of them go to Toad Hall , and Badger tries talking Toad out of his behaviour , to no avail . They put Toad under house arrest , with themselves as the guards , until Toad changes his mind . Feigning illness , Toad bamboozles the Water Rat ( who is on guard duty at the time ) and escapes . Badger and Mole are cross with Rat for his gullibility , but draw comfort because they need no longer waste their summer guarding Toad . However , Badger and Mole continue to live in Toad Hall in the hope that Toad may return . Meanwhile , Toad orders lunch at The Red Lion Inn , and then sees a motorcar pull into the courtyard . He steals the car , drives it recklessly and is caught by the police . He is sent to prison for 20 years ."

The novel recounts the authors ' childhood lives growing up in a household of 12 kids . The bestselling book was later adapted into a feature film by Twentieth Century Fox in 1950 and followed up by the sequel , Belles on Their Toes ( 1950 ) , which was adapted as a 1952 film . The book tells the story of time and motion study and efficiency experts Frank Bunker Gilbreth and Lillian Moller Gilbreth , and their children ( said to be 11 at the start of the movie and 11 actually appear on film , but a 12th is born by the end , ) , as they reside in Montclair , New Jersey for many years . This fictionalized version tells the story of real - life pioneering industrial / organizational psychologist Lillian Gilbreth , her husband , and children . Lillian Gilbreth was described in the 1940s as `` a genius in the art of living . '' The film was based on the best - selling biographical novel that two of her twelve children wrote about their childhoods . Gilbreth 's home doubled as a sort of real - world laboratory that tested her and her husband Frank 's ideas about efficiency ."

For instance , the park became Walley World , itself a good - natured parody of the Anaheim location , and the mascot , Marty Moose , is reminiscent of Walt Disney 's own Mickey Mouse . Similarly , Roy Walley 's appearance bears similarities to that of Disney and his name is similar to that of his brother Roy Disney . In the film , the Walley World theme park is represented by Santa Anita Park in Arcadia , California and Six Flags Magic Mountain in Valencia , California . Santa Anita Park 's large parking lot and blue - tinged fascia served as the exterior of Walley World , while all park interior scenes were shot at Magic Mountain . The two roller coasters seen in the film are The New Revolution , which can be recognized by the vertical loop , and Colossus , the duelling wooden roller coaster . The movie 's popularity gave rise to an ongoing cultural running gag of using the name `` Wally World '' ( spelled as `` Wally '' without an `` e '' ) as a nickname for real - life retailer Walmart ."

Hemostasis occurs when blood is present outside of the body or blood vessels . It is the instinctive response for the body to stop bleeding and loss of blood . During hemostasis three steps occur in a rapid sequence . Vascular spasm is the first response as the blood vessels constrict to allow less blood to be lost . In the second step , platelet plug formation , platelets stick together to form a temporary seal to cover the break in the vessel wall . The third and last step is called coagulation or blood clotting . Coagulation reinforces the platelet plug with fibrin threads that act as a `` molecular glue '' . Platelets are a large factor in the hemostatic process . They allow for the creation of the `` platelet plug '' that forms almost directly after a blood vessel has been ruptured . Within seconds of a blood vessel 's epithelial wall being disrupted platelets begin to adhere to the sub-endothelium surface . It takes approximately sixty seconds until the first fibrin strands begin to intersperse among the wound . After several minutes the platelet plug is completely formed by fibrin .

The song has won a number of awards , including an Academy Award for `` Best Original Song '' , a Golden Globe Award for `` Best Original Song '' , and a Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals . Singer - songwriter Previte was the lead singer of the band Franke and the Knockouts . He had success with the song `` Sweetheart '' in 1981 , but by 1986 was without a recording contract . In late 1986 or early 1987 , producer and head of Millennium Records , Jimmy Ienner , asked Previte about writing some music for `` a little movie called Dirty Dancing '' . Previte initially turned the request down because he was still trying to get a record deal , but Ienner was persistent , and got Previte to write several songs for the film , including `` Hungry Eyes '' , later recorded by singer Eric Carmen , which also became a top 10 hit ."

                    "`` Cake by the Ocean '' was co-written by Joe Jonas , Justin Tranter , and Swedish duo Mattman & Robin , who also produced the song . Lyrically , the song is about sexual intercourse , but is also often interpreted to be referring to the cocktail Sex on the Beach . The song 's title originated from Mattman & Robin 's repeatedly confusing the phrase `` sex on the beach '' for `` cake by the ocean . '' The song is composed in E minor , with a tempo of 120 beats per minute . The video , directed by Black Coffee and Jonas ' then - girlfriend Gigi Hadid , was released on October 16 , 2015 . It depicts DNCE performing `` in front of a giant piece of cake on the beach '' while a cake - throwing battle ensues between The Fat Jew and `` a bunch of bikini clad women who are ' Team DNCE ' '' . Both vie `` to become the ' cake fight champion , ' but as it turns out , everyone is a winner , as the scene becomes one giant beach party . '' DNCE have performed the song as musical guests on The Ellen DeGeneres Show and The Graham Norton Show . They performed the song live at the 2016 Radio Disney Music Awards , the 2016 Kids ' Choice Awards , and the 2016 Billboard Music Awards in the US , and the 2016 Royal Variety Performance in the UK ."

They became allied and transformed from workers ' rights organizations into a union as a result of a series of strikes in 1965 , when the mostly Filipino farmworkers of the AWOC in Delano , California initiated a grape strike , and the NFWA went on strike in support . As a result of the commonality in goals and methods , the NFWA and the AWOC formed the United Farm Workers Organizing Committee on August 22 , 1966 . This organization was accepted into the AFL - CIO in 1972 and changed its name to the United Farmworkers Union ."

                    "Theravada Buddhism is the religion of 70.2 % of the population of Sri Lanka . The island has been a center of Buddhist scholarship and learning since the introduction of Buddhism in the third century BCE producing eminent scholars such as Buddhaghosa and preserving the vast P\u0101li Canon . Throughout most of its history , Sinhalese kings have played a major role in the maintenance and revival of the Buddhist institutions of the island . During the 19th century , a modern Buddhist revival took place on the island which promoted Buddhist education and learning . There are around 6,000 Buddhist monasteries on Sri Lanka with approximately 15,000 monks . According to traditional Sri Lankan chronicles , such as the Dipavamsa , Buddhism was introduced into Sri Lanka in the third century BCE after the Third Buddhist council by Mahinda Bhikkhu , son of Emperor Ashoka , during the reign of Devanampiya Tissa of Anuradhapura . At the time of Mahinda arrival , he brought a sapling of the Bodhi Tree ( where Lord Buddha was enlightened ) to Sri Lanka and the first Buddhist monastery , monuments and monk were introduced Among these , the Isurumuniya and the Vessagiriya remain important centers of worship . He is also credited with the construction of the Pathamaka cetiya , the Jambukola vih\u0101ra and the Hatth\u0101lhaka vih\u0101ra and the refectory . The Pali Canon , having previously been preserved as an oral tradition , was first converted into writing in Sri Lanka around 30 BCE . Along with Mahinda came his sibling Sanghamitra . Who is also important as Mahinda. She gave the nun ordinace to women devotees . Mahavamsa \u00a7 29 records that during the rule of the Greco - Bactrian King Menander I , a Yona head monk named Mahadharmaraksita led 30,000 Buddhist monks from `` the Greek city of Alasandra '' ( v , around 150 kilometres ( 93 mi ) north of modern Kabul , Afghanistan ) to Sri Lanka for the dedication of the Ruwanwelisaya in Anuradhapura , indicating that Greco - Buddhism contributed to early Sri Lankan Buddhism .

Only two shipwrecks were found that dated from the 8th century BC . However , archeologists have found forty - six shipwrecks dated from the 4th century BC , which would appear to indicate that there occurred a very large increase in the volume of trade between these centuries . Considering that the average ship tonnage also increased in the same period , the total volume of trade increased probably by a factor of 30 . Greece 's main exports were olive oil , wine , pottery , and metalwork . Imports included grains and pork from Sicily , Arabia , Egypt , Ancient Carthage , Bosporan Kingdom . While peasants and artisans often sold their own wares , there were also retail merchants known as k\u00e1p\u00ealoi ( \u03ba\u03ac\u03c0\u03b7\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9 ) . Grouped into guilds , they sold fish , olive oil , and vegetables . Women sold perfume or ribbons . Merchants were required to pay a fee for their space in the marketplace . They were viewed poorly by the general population , and Aristotle labeled their activities as : `` a kind of exchange which is justly censured , for it is unnatural , and a mode by which men gain from one another .

                    "At the outset , the Royal Proclamation of 1763 defined the jurisdictional limits of the occupied territories of North America . Explaining parts of the Frontier expansion in North America , in Colonial America and especially Canada colony of New France , a diminutive new colony , the Province of Quebec was carved . The territory northeast of the St. John River on the Labrador coast was placed under the Newfoundland Colony . The lands west of Quebec and west of a line running along the crest of the Allegheny mountains became Indian territory , temporarily barred to settlement , to the great disappointment of the land speculators of Virginia and Pennsylvania , who had started the Seven Years ' War to gain these territories . The proclamation created a boundary line ( often called the proclamation line ) between the British colonies on the Atlantic coast and American Indian lands ( called the Indian Reserve ) west of the Appalachian Mountains . The proclamation line was not intended to be a permanent boundary between the colonists and Aboriginal lands , but rather a temporary boundary which could be extended further west in an orderly , lawful manner . It was also not designed as an uncrossable boundary ; people could cross the line , just not settle past it . Its contour was defined by the headwaters that formed the watershed along the Appalachians . All land with rivers that flowed into the Atlantic was designated for the colonial entities , while all the land with rivers that flowed into the Mississippi was reserved for the native Indian population . The proclamation outlawed the private purchase of Native American land , which had often created problems in the past . Instead , all future land purchases were to be made by Crown officials `` at some public Meeting or Assembly of the said Indians '' . Furthermore , British colonials were forbidden to settle on native lands , and colonial officials were forbidden to grant ground or lands without royal approval . The proclamation gave the Crown a monopoly on all future land purchases from American Indians . British colonists and land speculators objected to the proclamation boundary since the British government had already assigned land grants to them . Many settlements already existed beyond the proclamation line , some of which had been temporarily evacuated during Pontiac 's War , and there were many already granted land claims yet to be settled . For example , George Washington and his Virginia soldiers had been granted lands past the boundary . Prominent American colonials joined with the land speculators in Britain to lobby the government to move the line further west . Their efforts were successful , and the boundary line was adjusted in a series of treaties with the Native Americans . In 1768 the Treaty of Fort Stanwix and the Treaty of Hard Labour , followed in 1770 by the Treaty of Lochaber , opened much of what is now Kentucky and West Virginia to British settlement ."

Each of Frank 's sons followed him into the NYPD : Danny ( Donnie Wahlberg ) is a Detective 1st Grade and lead investigator with the 54th Precinct 's Detective Squad ; Joe was a Detective with the Warrants Squad who was murdered on the orders of his partner Sonny Malevsky ( Michael T. Weiss ) , the leader of a corrupt gang of police officers called the Blue Templar ; and Jamie ( Will Estes ) is a patrol officer assigned to the 12th Precinct with a law degree from Harvard University . Frank 's only daughter , Erin ( Bridget Moynahan ) , is also in law enforcement as a Manhattan Assistant District Attorney . Erin was promoted to Deputy Bureau Chief of the NYCDA 's Trial Bureau in 2013 . In addition to his children , Frank is also a loving grandfather to Erin 's daughter , Nicky Reagan - Boyle ( Sami Gayle ) , and Danny 's two children , Jack ( Tony Terraciano ) and Sean Reagan ( Andrew Terraciano ) . In one episode , it is mentioned that Frank 's wife 's grandfather was one of the builders on the Brooklyn Bridge in the 1870s and ' 80s . Frank 's dad 's father , Charles Reagan , was an Irish immigrant who served in World War I before becoming a police officer . Charles was the one who taught him how to fish . In `` Whistle Blower '' ( season 2 , episode 10 ) , Frank mentions his great - uncle Teddy Reagan , a member of the NYPD Mounted Unit , who spent a cold night in a boxcar with his horse , Dolly , and woke up in Pittsburgh . Growing up , Frank became friends with Angelo Gallo ( Chazz Palminteri ) , who grew up to be one of the top mafia lawyers . After Gallo was shot on the orders of a former client , Frank has him publicly arrested for hindering prosecution , to protect him from being considered a rat . Another close friend of his is Monsignor Walter Donahue , a member of the city archdiocese ."

                    "The history of basketball began with its invention in 1891 in Springfield , Massachusetts by Canadian physical education instructor James Naismith as a less injury - prone sport than football . The game became established fairly quickly and grew very popular as the 20th century progressed , first in America and then throughout the world . After basketball became established in American colleges , the professional game followed . The American National Basketball Association ( NBA ) , established in 1946 , grew to a multibillion - dollar enterprise by the end of the century , and basketball became an integral part of American culture . The game of basketball as it is known today was created by Dr. James Naismith in December 1891 in Springfield , Massachusetts , to condition young athletes during cold months . It consisted of peach baskets and a soccer style ball . He published 13 rules for the new game . He divided his class of eighteen into two teams of nine players each and set about to teach them the basics of his new game . The objective of the game was to throw the basketball into the fruit baskets nailed to the lower railing of the gym balcony . Every time a point was scored , the game was halted so the janitor could bring out a ladder and retrieve the ball . After a while , the bottoms of the fruit baskets were removed . The first public basketball game was played in Springfield , Massachusetts , on March 11 , 1892 ."

                    "The fictional superhero Batman , who appears in American comic books published by DC Comics , has appeared in various films since his inception . Created by Bob Kane and Bill Finger , the character first starred in two serial films in the 1940s , Batman and Batman and Robin . The character also appeared in the 1966 film Batman , which was a feature film adaptation of the 1960s Batman TV series starring Adam West and Burt Ward , who also starred in the film . Toward the end of the 1980s , the Warner Bros. studio began producing a series of feature films starring Batman , beginning with the 1989 film Batman , directed by Tim Burton and starring Michael Keaton . Burton and Keaton returned for the 1992 sequel Batman Returns , and in 1995 , Joel Schumacher directed Batman Forever with Val Kilmer as Batman . Schumacher also directed the 1997 sequel Batman & Robin , which starred George Clooney . Batman & Robin was poorly received by both critics and fans , leading to the cancellation of Batman Unchained . Over the course of seven years , Warner Bros. commissioned Darren Aronofsky for an adaptation of Batman : Year One and Wolfgang Petersen for Batman vs. Superman before deciding to reboot the film franchise in 2005 with Batman Begins , directed by Christopher Nolan and starring Christian Bale . Nolan returned to direct two further installments through the release of The Dark Knight in 2008 and The Dark Knight Rises in 2012 , with Bale reprising his role in both films . Both sequels earned over $1 billion worldwide , making Batman the second film franchise to have two of its films earn more than $1 billion worldwide . Referred to as The Dark Knight Trilogy , the critical acclaim and commercial success of Nolan 's films have been credited with restoring widespread popularity to the superhero , with the second installment considered one of the best superhero movies of all - time . Ben Affleck became the newest actor to portray Batman in 2016 with Batman v Superman : Dawn of Justice , which began a sequence of DC Comics adaptations that Warner Bros. refers to as the DC Extended Universe , including Justice League , a crossover film featuring other DC Comics characters , in 2017 , and a stand - alone Batman film starring Affleck and directed by Matt Reeves that is set for release in 2019 . Batman has also appeared in multiple animated films , both as a starring character and as an ensemble character . While most animated films were released direct - to - video , the 1993 animated feature Batman : Mask of the Phantasm , based on the 1990s Batman : The Animated Series , was released theatrically . Having earned a total of U.S. $2,407,708,129 the Batman series is the fifth - highest - grossing film series in North America ."

                    "Due to Africa 's position across equatorial and subtropical latitudes in both the northern and southern hemisphere , several different climate types can be found on the continent of Africa . Africa mainly lies within the intertropical zone between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn . Only the northernmost and the southernmost fringes of the continent have a Mediterranean climate . Because of this geographical situation , Africa is a hot continent as the solar radiation intensity is always high . Thus , warm and hot climates prevails all over Africa but the northern part is the most marked part by aridity and high temperatures . The climate of Africa is a range of climates such as the equatorial climate , the tropical wet and dry climate , the tropical monsoon climate , the semi-desert climate ( semi-arid ) , the desert climate ( hyper - arid and arid ) , the subtropical highland climate etc . Temperate climates remain rare through the continent except at very high elevations and along the fringes . In fact , the climate of Africa is more dependent to rainfall amount than to temperatures as they are consistently high . African deserts are the sunniest and the driest parts of the continent due to the prevailing presence of the subtropical ridge with subsiding , hot , dry air masses . Africa holds many heat - related records : the continent has the hottest extended region year - round , the areas with the hottest summer climate , the highest sunshine duration etc . Globally , heating of the earth near the equator leads to large amounts of upward motion and convection along the monsoon trough or Intertropical convergence zone . The divergence over the near - equatorial trough leads to air rising and moving away from the equator aloft . As it moves towards the Mid-Latitudes , the air cools and sinks , which leads to subsidence near the 30th parallel of both hemispheres . This circulation is known as the Hadley cell and leads to the formation of the subtropical ridge . Many of the world 's deserts are caused by these climatological high - pressure areas , including the Sahara Desert ."

                    "Potato chips are a predominant part of the snack food and convenience food market in Western countries . The global potato chip market generated total revenues of US $16.49 billion in 2005 . This accounted for 35.5 % of the total savory snacks market in that year ( $46.1 billion ) . The earliest known recipe for potato chips is in William Kitchiner 's cookbook The Cook 's Oracle , first published in 1817 , which was a bestseller in England and the United States . The 1822 edition 's version of recipe 104 is called `` Potatoes fried in Slices or Shavings '' and reads `` peel large potatoes , slice them about a quarter of an inch thick , or cut them in shavings round and round , as you would peel a lemon ; dry them well in a clean cloth , and fry them in lard or dripping '' . Early recipes for potato chips in the United States are found in Mary Randolph 's Virginia House - Wife ( 1824 ) , and in N.K.M. Lee 's Cook 's Own Book ( 1832 ) , both of which explicitly cite Kitchiner . However , a legend associates the creation of potato chips with Saratoga Springs , New York , decades later . By the late nineteenth century , a popular version of the story attributed the dish to George Crum , a half - black , half - Native American cook at Moon 's Lake House , who was trying to appease an unhappy customer on 24 August 1853 . The customer kept sending his French - fried potatoes back , complaining that they were too thick , too `` soggy , '' and / or not salted well enough . Frustrated , Crum personally sliced several potatoes extremely thin , fried the potato slices to a crisp , and seasoned them with extra salt . To Crum 's surprise , the customer loved them . They soon came to be called `` Saratoga Chips , '' a name that persisted into at least the mid-twentieth century . A version of this story popularized in a 1973 national advertising campaign by St. Regis Paper Company , which manufactured packaging for chips , said that Crum 's customer was Cornelius Vanderbilt . Crum was already renowned as a chef at the time , and by 1860 , he owned his own lakeside restaurant , which he called Crum 's House ."

Like any chain , the chain of survival is only as strong as its weakest link . The four interdependent links in the chain of survival are early access , early CPR , early defibrillation , and early advanced cardiac life support The `` chain of survival '' metaphor was first published in the March 1981 newsletter of CPR for Citizens in Orlando , Florida . It was further developed by Mary M. Newman of the Sudden Cardiac Arrest Foundation , and used as a slogan for the 1988 Conference on Citizen CPR , and described in an article she wrote for the Journal of Emergency Medical Services in 1989 , and in an editorial she wrote for the first issue of Currents in Emergency Cardiac Care in 1990 . The American Heart Association adopted the concept and elaborated on it in its 1992 guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency cardiac care , The International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation ( ILCOR ) echoed the concept in 1997 ."

Because of the federalist underpinnings of the division between sovereign federal and state governments , the various state court systems are free to operate in ways that vary widely from those of the federal government , and from one another . In practice , however , every state has adopted a division of its judiciary into at least two levels , and almost every state has three levels , with trial courts hearing cases which may be reviewed by appellate courts , and finally by a state supreme court . A few states have two separate supreme courts , with one having authority over civil matters and the other reviewing criminal cases . 47 states and the federal government allow at least one appeal of right from a final judgment on the merits , meaning that the court receiving the appeal must decide the appeal after it is briefed and argued properly . Three states do not provide a right to a first appeal . Rather , they give litigants only a right to petition for the right to have an appeal heard ."

The song is performed by Tevye , the main character in the musical , and reflects his dreams of glory .

The lyric is based in part on passages from Sholem Aleichem 's 1899 short story `` The Bubble Bursts . '' Both stories appeared in English in the 1949 collection of stories Tevye 's Daughters ."

                    "Snowboarding is a sport at the Winter Olympic Games . It was first included in the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano , Japan . Snowboarding was one of five new sports or disciplines added to the Winter Olympic program between 1992 and 2002 , and was the only one not to have been a previous medal or demonstration event . In 1998 , four events , two for men and two for women , were held in two specialities : the giant slalom , a downhill event similar to giant slalom skiing ; and the half - pipe , in which competitors perform tricks while going from one side of a semi-circular ditch to the other . Canadian Ross Rebagliati won the men 's giant slalom and became the first athlete to win a gold medal in snowboarding . Rebagliati was briefly stripped of his medal by the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) after testing positive for marijuana . However , the IOC 's decision was reverted following an appeal from the Canadian Olympic Association . For the 2002 Winter Olympics , giant slalom was expanded to add head - to - head racing and was renamed parallel giant slalom . In 2006 , a third event , the snowboard cross , was held for the first time . In this event , competitors race against each other down a course with jumps , beams and other obstacles . On July 11 , 2011 , the International Olympic Committee 's Executive Board approved the addition of Ski and Snowboard Slopestyle to the Winter Olympics roster of events , effective in 2014 . The decision was announced via press conference from the IOC 's meeting in Durban , South Africa . A fifth event , parallel slalom , was added only for 2014 . Big air was added for 2018 . Six athletes have won at least two medals . Shaun White of the United States is the only triple gold medalist . Philipp Schoch of Switzerland and Seth Wescott of the United States are the only double gold medalists . Karine Ruby of France and Americans Ross Powers and Danny Kass also won two medals . In the men 's half - pipe event , American snowboarders have collected six of nine possible medals , achieving a unique medal sweep in 2002 . The United States won a total of 24 medals , more than any other nation . The Americans and the Swiss collected ten and seven gold medals respectively . As of the 2014 Winter Olympics , 90 medals ( 30 of each color ) have been awarded since 1998 , and have been won by snowboarders from 21 National Olympic Committees ."

The Nile , which is 6,853 km ( 4,258 miles ) long , is an `` international '' river as its drainage basin covers eleven countries , namely , Tanzania , Uganda , Rwanda , Burundi , the Democratic Republic of the Congo , Kenya , Ethiopia , Eritrea , South Sudan , Republic of the Sudan and Egypt . In particular , the Nile is the primary water source of Egypt and Sudan . The Nile River has two major tributaries , the White Nile and Blue Nile . The White Nile is considered to be the headwaters and primary stream of the Nile itself . The Blue Nile , however , is the source of most of the water and silt . The White Nile is longer and rises in the Great Lakes region of central Africa , with the most distant source still undetermined but located in either Rwanda or Burundi . It flows north through Tanzania , Lake Victoria , Uganda and South Sudan . The Blue Nile ( Amharic : \u12d3\u1263\u12ed , \u02bf\u0100bay ) begins at Lake Tana in Ethiopia and flows into Sudan from the southeast . The two rivers meet just north of the Sudanese capital of Khartoum ."

                    "The historical phenomenon of colonization is one that stretches around the globe and across time . Modern state global colonialism , or imperialism , began in the 15th century with the `` Age of Discovery '' , led by Portuguese and Spanish exploration of the Americas , the coasts of Africa , the Middle East , India and East Asia . The Spanish and Portuguese empires were the first global empires because they were the first to stretch across different continents , covering vast territories around the globe . In 1492 , notable explorer Christopher Columbus `` discovered '' America . The phrase `` the empire on which the sun never sets '' was first used for the Spanish Empire in the 16th century . During the late 16th and 17th centuries , England , France and the Dutch Republic also established their own overseas empires , in direct competition with each other . The end of the 18th and early 19th century saw the first era of decolonization , when most of the European colonies in the Americas gained their independence from their respective metropoles . Spain was irreversibly weakened after the loss of their New World colonies , but the Kingdom of Great Britain ( uniting Scotland with England and Wales ) , France , Portugal , and the Dutch turned their attention to the Old World , particularly South Africa , India and South East Asia , where coastal enclaves had already been established . The second industrial revolution , in the 19th century , led to what has been termed the era of New Imperialism , when the pace of colonization rapidly accelerated , the height of which was the Scramble for Africa , in which Belgium , Germany and Italy were also participants . During the 20th century , the colonies of the defeated central powers in World War I were distributed amongst the victors as mandates , but it was not until the end of World War II that the second phase of decolonization began in earnest . In 1999 , Portugal gave up the last of Europe 's colonies in Asia , Macau , to China , ending an era that had lasted six hundred years ."

It was invented by Housam Roumi and reached its height of popularity under S\u00fcleyman I the Magnificent ( 1520 -- 1566 ) . It was labeled the Diwani script because it was used in the Ottoman diwan and was one of the secrets of the sultan 's palace . The rules of this script were not known to everyone , but confined to its masters and a few bright students . It was used in the writing of all royal decrees , endowments , and resolutions . A Diwani text adorned with a tugrah , a complex calligraphic seal , represented the authority of the Sultan and the Ottoman state ."
