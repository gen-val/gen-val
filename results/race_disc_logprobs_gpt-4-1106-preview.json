        "context": "In the market of luxury   brands, Chinese consumers are only second to the Japanese in the world.\nAcross the globe it's clear that the young generation are increasingly relying on expensive brands for their self-image.\nPersonally I am a fashion-lover, at least in spirit. I love to look at clothes and shoes. But I don't understand why people spend large amounts of money on designer labels. Certainly, young people, whether in China or elsewhere, should be building their self-confidence in other ways. When a young woman shows off a handbag worth two months' salary, that's a scary thing.\nWhat are the psychological factors forcing young people to take on debt for designer items?\nThe desire to say, \"Hey, look at me. I'm wealthy. I have social status.\"\nScientists have found the acquisition of luxury brands doesn't lead to happiness. Study after study has shown that, although we are born to desire material possessions, when we get them, we don't suddenly become \"happy people\".\nIn fact, a series of studies by Leaf Van Boven at the University of Colorado, US, have shown that individuals who invest   in travel and other experiences get more pleasure than those who invest in material things. That's because experiences are more easily combined into a person's identity. If I travel to Yunnan, that adventure affects how I think. My memories entertain my friends and colleagues. It follows, then, that investing in experiences improves my chances for successful social relationships.\nMoreover, as Van Boven has observed, young people who pursue happiness through \"things\" are liked less by others than young people who seek happiness through experiences. \nThis research is pretty solid, but I suspect it won't persuade young people not to desire a style. It's natural to want to express yourself through your appearance. So my advice is, create a look that isn't tied to a designer label. \nYou don't have to  _ to send a message about who you are. Take a trip. Go out into the world. Then come back and confidently create your own signature look.",

And this Easter, on top of my regular checklist, I had to buy the ingredient  for a delicious, new recipe I'd discovered: sliced ham and turkey layered with Swiss cheese and cabbage, all wrapped in pastry dough.\nTrouble was that my work schedule had left me no time to shop earlier in the week. I would get up extra early and take care of everything on Saturday morning, I thought, as I drove to the office on Friday. But that morning, Yola, one of my co-workers, asked if my husband Robert and I would help her move the next day. \"I really don't have anybody else to ask,\" she apologized.\n\"Sure,\" I told her, soft touch that I am. Early Saturday morning, Robert, my 15-year-old son Ben, and I drove our truck to her old apartment. Oh, the piles of furniture and boxes! It took us till late afternoon to get her settled in her new place.\nBy the time we returned home, I was exhausted. I don't know how I'm going to go shopping now, let alone cook Easter dinner, I thought. The only ingredient I had at home was the cabbage. On the kitchen counter were two shopping bags of food that Yola had sent home with us -- her thanks for helping her move. She was leaving on a trip the next day, and didn't want the food to go to waste.\nI reached into the first bag and pulled out a package of sliced ham. Well, that's lucky, I thought. Then I pulled out a package of sliced turkey, and another of Swiss cheese. That's strange, I thought. There's no way Yola knew my Easter dinner plans. I reached back into the grocery bag, thinking of the Easter miracle. All of a sudden, the strangest feeling came over me. I lifted it out.

        "context": "Take That Tiger Mom\nIn the ongoing battle between Tiger Moms, French Mamas, and everyone else who wants to know what is the best way to raise their kids, a new study adds evidence that the extreme Tiger-style may do more harm than good.\nAuthoritarian parents are more likely to end up with disrespectful children with violent behaviors, the study found, compared to parents who listen to their kids with the goal of gaining trust.\nIt was the first study to look at how parenting styles affect the way teens view their parents and, in turn, how they behave.\nThe study considered three general styles of parenting. Authoritative parents are demanding and controlling while also being warm and sensitive to their children's needs.\nAuthoritarian parents, on the contrary, are demanding and controlling without the appearance of caring, attachment and receptiveness. They take a \"my way or the highway\" approach to their kids.\nPermissive parents, the third group, have warm and receptive qualities, but they set few boundaries and carry out few rules.\nUsing data on early 600 kids from an ongoing study of middle school and high school students in New Hampshire, researchers from the University of New Hampshire were able to find \"my way or the highway\" parenting with more violent behaviors like robbery, drug-taking, and attacking someone else with the intention of hurting or killing.\nFirm but loving parenting, on the other hand, led to fewer lawbreakers. Permissive parenting, surprisingly, didn't seem to make much of a difference either.\nTo explain the link between parenting style and behavior in kids, the researchers suggested that what matters most is how reasonable kids think their parents' power is. This sense comes when kids trust that their parents are making the best decisions for them and believe that they need to do what their parents say even if they don't always like how their parents are treating them.\nWhen kids respect the power of their parents, the researchers reported in the journal of Adolescence, their behavior is better. Previous research has also linked firm but caring parenting with kids who have more self-control and independence.\n\"When children consider their parents to be the reliable figure, they trust the parents and feel that they have a duty to do what their parents tell them to do,\" said lead researcher Pick Trinkner. \"This is very important as the parent doesn't have to rely on a system of rewards and punishments to control behavior and the child is more likely to follow the rules when the parent is not physically present.\"",

It's important to do so in a proper way, no matter whether you are introducing yourself to someone, or introducing two people. To keep you aware of this, we have gathered tips on how to make a proper introduction.\n*Always stand when making an introduction.\nWhen you are seated and someone comes up to greet you, make the effort to stand up. By doing this, you show respect for yourself and for the other person.\n*Always keep eye contact while making an introduction.\nMany people are not aware of the value of this simple action. When you make eye contact, you are giving a confident image.\n*Always introduce a person of lesser authority to one of greater authority. The most important thing to remember is to say the most important person's name first.\nFor example, when introducing your supervisor to a job candidate  , you would give your supervisor's name first. \"Bob Jones, may I introduce Susan Lee, who has just graduated from ABC University?\"\n*In a situation where rank is unimportant, an introduction is based on sex and age. A man is presented to a woman and a younger woman to an older woman.\nWhat if you find yourself in a situation where you have forgotten the other person's name? Start with a handshake and reintroduce   yourself. When doing this, you will usually cause the other person to do the same.\nHowever, if the other person does not take your suggestion, it is OK simply to apologize and let the person know that you cannot remember her or his name. This is not the ideal situation, of course, but it does happen to all of us. The other person should be forgiving.",

        "question": "When he was asked about the most important thing he had done in life at a presentation, the author    _   .",
        "context": "\"What is the most important thing you've done in your life?\" The question was put to me during a presentation I gave to a group of lawyers.\nThe answer came to me in an instant. It's not the one I gave, because the situation was not right. As a lawyer in the entertainment industry, I knew the audience wanted to hear some amusing stories about my work with well-known people, but here's the true answer:\nThe most important thing I've ever done occurred on October 8,1990. I began the day playing tennis with an old friend I hadn't seen for a while. Between points we talked about what had been happening in each other's lives. He and his wife had just had a baby boy, who was keeping them up at night.\nWhile we were playing, a car came screaming up the road toward the courts. It was my friend's father, who shouted to my friend that his baby had stopped breathing and was being rushed to the hospital. In a flash my friend was in the car and gone, disappearing in a cloud of dust.\nFor a moment I just stood there, paralyzed . Then I tried to figure out what I should do. Follow my friend to the hospital? There was nothing I could accomplish there, I convinced myself. My friend's son was in the care of doctors and nurses, and nothing I could do or say would affect the outcome. Be there for moral support? Well, maybe. But my friend and his wife both had large families, and I knew they'd be surrounded by relatives who would provide more than enough comfort and support, whatever happened. All I could do at the hospital, I decided, was to get in the way. Also, I had planned a full day with my family, who were waiting for me to get home. So I decided to head back to my house and check in my friend later.\nAs I started my car, I realized that my friend had left his truck and keys at the courts. I now faced another problem. I couldn't leave the keys in the truck. So I decided to go to the hospital and give him the keys.\nWhen I arrived, I was directed to a room where my friend and his wife were waiting. As I had thought, the room was filled with family members silently watching my friend comfort his wife. I went in and stood by the door, trying to decide what to do next. Soon a doctor appeared. He approached my friend and his wife, and in a quiet voice told them that their son had died.\nFor a long time the two held each other and cried, unaware of the rest of us standing around in pained silence. After they had calmed themselves, the doctor suggested they spend a few moments with their son.\nMy friend and his wife stood up and walked past their families. When they reached the door, my friend saw me standing in the corner. He came over and hugged me and started to cry. My friend's wife hugged me, too, and said , \"Thanks for being here.\"\nFor the rest of that morning, I sat in the emergency room of that hospital and watched my friend and his wife hold the body of their infant son, and say goodbye.\nIt's the most important thing I have ever done. The experience taught me two lessons.\nFirst: The most important thing I've ever done happened when I was completely helpless. None of the things I had learned in university, in three years of law school or in six years of legal practice were of any use in that situation. Something terrible was happening to people I cared about, and I was powerless to change the outcome. All I could do was standing by and watching it happen. And yet it was critical that I do just that--- just be there when someone needed me.\nSecond: The most important thing I've done almost didn't happen because of things I had learned in classroom and professional life. Law school taught me how to take a set of facts, break them down and organized them. These skills are critical for lawyers. When people come to us for help, they're often stressed out and depend on a lawyer to think logically. But while learning to think, I almost forget how to feel. Today I have no doubt that I should have leapt into my car without hesitation and followed my friend to the hospital.\nFrom that one experience I learned that the most important thing in life isn't the money you make, the status you attain or the honors you achieve.",

        "context": "Six seconds after its launch in Virginia, US, an unmanned rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS) exploded, disappointing people both on Earth and in space.\nHundreds of millions of dollars worth of cargo was destroyed in the Oct. 28 explosion due to An\"equipment failure\", said Orbital Sciences, the company hired by NASA for the resupply mission.\nThe rocket was carrying a cargo ship loaded with 2,200 kilograms of supplies such as food, tools, parts, and experiments. Roughly a third of the cargo was a series of scientific investigations. Some of them were from high school students in the US. For example, 10 students from the Cristo Rey Jesuit College Preparatory School of Houston were conducting experiments about microgravity and put their samples on the rocket.  \"I know that failure is a part of science, but I really feel sorry for my students,\" science teacher Greg Adragna told the Houston,  Chronicle .\nAstronauts at the ISS felt a more urgent disappointment, however. The cargo included 617kg of food. Now they will have to rely on supplies from a Russian launch on Oct. 29.\nLaunched in 1998 and involving the US, Russia, Canada, Japan, and the member countries of the European Space Agency, the ISS is one of the most ambitious international collaborations in history. Currently, there are six astronauts at the station, five male and one female. Three are from Russia, two are from the US, and one is from Germany.  They have lived together for about six months. The station gets regular resupplies from Earth, using unmanned spacecrafts. Food is always a big part of the supplies.  Most of the food is frozen and ready to eat, and often tastes bad-somewhat like trying to eat when you have a heavy cold.\nTo make space life better, however, scientists have made breakthroughs. Earlier this year, Russian astronauts managed to grow a variety of crops aboard the station. Next year they are going to try to grow rice and other plants. And, as transporting water to space is expensive, astronauts are looking for ways to recycle water. \"Astronauts on board the ISS already drink water distilled from sweat and urine<) ,\" Russian news agency RIA Novosti reported.\nIs that the reason the astronauts were so disappointed not to get the water from the failed resupply mission, by any chance?",

If people go \"Dutch treat\", or simply \"go Dutch\", it means that they will share the expenses of a social engagement.\nThere are many other \"Dutch\" expressions in English, many of which were invented in Britain in the seventeenth century, when the Dutch and the English were commercial and military rivals. The British used \"Dutch\" to refer to something bad, cheap and shameful. A \"Dutch bargain\" at that time was an uneven, one-sided deal; \"Dutch reckoning\" was an unitemized  account; and \"Dutch widow\" was slang for prostitute. Later centuries brought in \"Dutch courage\", for bravery caused by drink; \"Dutch concert\", for noisy music; \"Dutch nightingale\", meaning a frog; and \"double Dutch\", for incomprehensible language or talk.\nSome of the expressions are still in use today, but some are not. In fact, in American English, some \"Dutch\" expressions have nothing to do with the Dutch, but something with the German. It was probably because of the similar spelling and pronunciation that people made a mistake in distinguishing between \"Dutch\" and \"Deutsch\" (the German word for German), when German immigrants came to America in the 1700s. For instance, \"the Pennsylvania Dutch\" refers to the German descendants, instead of the Dutch descendants, living in Pennsylvania.",

        "context": "Anyone who doubts that children are born with a healthy amount of ambition need spend only a few minutes with a baby eagerly learning to walk. No matter how many times the little ones stumble in their first efforts, most keep on trying, determined to master their amazing new skill. It is only several years later, many psychologists and teachers agree, that a good number of kids seem to lose their natural drive to succeed. For the parents of such kids, whose own ambition is often tied to their children's success, it can be a painful experience.\nFiguring out why _ is the first step. Assuming that a kid doesn't suffer from a learning disability, or isn't involved in some family crisis at home, many educators attribute a sudden lack of motivation to a fear of failure or classmate pressure. \"Everything is within the kids' control; their intelligence is changeable,\" says Lisa Blackwell, a research scientist at Columbia University. \"More than any teacher or workshop,\" Blackwell says, \"parents can play a key role in conveying this message to their children by praising their effort, and progress rather than emphasizing their 'smartness' or praising high performance alone. Most importantly, parents should let their kids know that mistakes are a part of learning.\"\nSome experts say our education system, with its strong emphasis on testing and separation of students into different levels of ability, also bears blame for the disappearance of drive in some kids. \"These programs shut down the motivation of all kids who aren't considered gifted and talented. They destroy their confidence,\" says Jeff Howard, a social psychologist. Howard and other educators say it's important to expose kids to a world beyond homework and tests, through volunteer work, sports, hobbies and other extracurriculum activities.\n\"The problem of the issue is that many students experience education as irrelevant to their life goals and ambitions,\" says Michael Nakkual, a Harvard education professor. The key to getting kids to aim higher at school is to free them of the idea that class work is irrelevant, to show them how doing well at school can actually help them fulfill their dreams beyond it. They need to understand that you have to learn to walk before you can run.",

        "context": "When Caleb Forbes got his first job at an advertising company at the age of 20, he thought he would be at the company for years. But after seven months he was bored. Soon after that, Forbes moved to London. He took four different jobs at three companies over the next five years. Forbes wanted a better job and higher pay---he was never quite satisfied.\nWelcome to the world of a job hopper. Forbes's story isn't unusual these days and such frequent movement from one job to the next will become more common. The main reason: the nature of employment is changing. There are a lot more contracts and part-time jobs or flexible employment. That leads to people having a greater number of jobs. What's more, layoffs  and pay freezes , among other things, have pushed people from one job to another. In some cases, a bad worldwide job market has limited opportunities for star employees, promoting them to seek new challenges at other companies.\nHowever, employers often think that if a person jumped from his last employer after a short period, he will likely do the same again --- there is a significant financial risk in hiring someone who leaves in short order.\nWhat's more, moving from company to company frequently doesn't mean workers are climbing the corporate ladder  faster. In 2005, Monika Hamori, a professor at Spain's IE Business School, looked at CEOs at about 55 to see if those who moved around more frequently climbed the ladder faster.\nShe found that executives who stayed with one company became CEOs after 23 years, while executives who changed companies many times became CEOs after 26 years. One reason: workers within the same organization tend to be promoted more frequently and be offered better jobs.",

        "context": "Bruce Jun Fan Lee was born in the hour of the Dragon, between 6 and 8 a.m., in the \"Year of the Dragon\" on November 27, 1940 at the Jackson Street Hospital in San Francisco's Chinatown. Today, a plaque   in the hospital's entry remembers the place of his birth. Bruce's birth, in the hour and the year of Dragon, is a powerful symbol in Chinese astrology  . It would be a strong indication of the powerful life that was to be lived by Bruce Lee and the explosive influence his life would have on countless others.\nAt the age of three months, Lee Hoi Chuen, his wife Grace and baby Bruce returned to Hong Kong where Bruce would be raised until the age of 18. Probably because of the long ocean voyage and the change in climates, Bruce was not a strong child in his very early years, a condition that would change when he took up the study of kung fu at the age of 13.\nAt the age of 13, Bruce was introduced to Master Yip Man, a teacher of the Wing Chun style of kung fu. For five years Bruce studied diligently and became very proficient. Regarding Yip Man as a master teacher and wise man, Bruce respected him greatly and frequently visited with him in later years. When he first took up kung fu, he used his new skills to fight his \"enemies\", but it did not take long for Bruce to learn that the real value of martial arts training is that the skills of physical combat   build up confidence to the point that one does not feel the constant need to defend one's honor through fighting.\nIn high school, Bruce, now no longer a weak child, was beginning to improve his body through hard training. One of his accomplishments was winning an interschool Boxing Championship against an English student. Given the graceful movements, which would later be spectacularly displayed in his films, it is no surprise that Bruce was also an excellent dancer, and in 1958 he won the Hong Kong Cha Cha Championship.\nAt the age of 18, Bruce was looking for new prospect in his life, as were his parents who were discouraged that Bruce had not made much progress academically. His family decided that it was time for him to return to the land of his birth and find his future there. In April of 1959, with $100 in his pocket, Bruce boarded a steamship and began his voyage to San Francisco.",

As she tried to gather her cows to a higher ground, she slipped and hit her head on a fallen tree trunk. The fall made her unconscious for a moment or two. When she came to, Lizzie, one of her oldest and favorite cows, was licking her face. \nAt that time, the water level on the farm was still rising. Nancy gathered all her strength to get up and began walking slowly with Lizzie. The rain had become much heavier, and the water in the field was now waist high. Nancy's pace got slower and slower because she felt a great pain in her head. Finally, all she could do was to throw her arm around Lizzie's neck and try to hang on. About 20 minutes later, Lizzie managed to pull herself and Nancy out of the rising water and onto a bit of high land, which seemed like a small island in the middle of a lake of white water. \nEven though it was about noon, the sky was so dark and the rain and lightning was so bad that it took rescuers more than two hours to discover Nancy. A man from a helicopter  lowered a rope, but Nancy couldn't catch it. A moment later, two men landed on the small island from a ladder in the helicopter. They raised her into the helicopter and took her to the school gym, where the Red Cross had set up an emergency shelter. \nWhen the flood disappeared two days later, Nancy immediately went back to the \"island.\" Lizzie was gone. She was one of 19 cows that Nancy had lost in the flood. \"I owe my life to her,\" said Nancy with tears.",

He focuses on his passion for baseball and working hard to improve the pitches   that have kept him off the school team.\nMexican Whiteboy, by Matt de la Pena, is about a teenager's search for identity. It was named as one of the Top Ten Best Books for Young Adults in 2009 by the US Young Adult Library Services Association.\nWhen Lopez's mother decides to go to live with her wealthy white boyfriend in San Francisco, he chooses to spend the summer with his father's family in San Diego. It's a trip to explore roots and self-identity, filled with unexpected friendship.\nThere he meets Uno, of mixed heritage   like himself, also with a divorced mom. Uno understands Danny's split background and helps him improve his baseball skills. Both boys have big league dreams, but they both have to learn to come to terms with their mixed heritages before they can achieve their goals.\nAside from discussions of racism, Mexican Whiteboy takes on other issues, such as the importance of family and the negative influence of hiding the truth.

There was little unknown land left in the world. People didn't have to explore  much any more. They began to work to make life better instead.\nIn the second half of the 19th century many great inventions were made. Among them were the camera, the electric light and the radio. These all became a big part of our life today. The first part of the 20th century saw more great inventions. The helicopter in 1909. Sound movies in 1926. The computer in 1928, and jet planes in 1930. This was also a time when a new material was made. Nylon came out in 1935. It changed the kind of clothes people wear. The middle part of the 20th brought new ways to help people get over diseases. They worked very well. They made people healthier and let them live long lives. By the 1960s most people could expect to live to be at least 60. By this time most people had a very good life. Of course new inventions continued to be made. But man now had a wish to explore again.

        "context": "There are two factors which determine an individual's intelligence. The first is the sort of brain he is born with. Human brains differ considerably, some being more capable than others. But no matter how good a brain he has to begin with, an individual will have a low order of intelligence unless he has opportunities to learn. So the second factor is what happens to the individual--the sort of environment in which he is reared  . If an individual is handicapped   environmentally, it is likely that his brain will fail to develop and he will never attain the level of intelligence of which he is capable.\nThe importance of environment in determining an individual's intelligence can be demonstrated by the case history of the identical twins, Peter and Mark X. Being identical, the twins had identical brains at birth, and their growth processes were the same. When the twins were three months old, their parents died, and they were placed in separate foster homes. Peter was reared by parents of low intelligence in an isolated community with poor educational opportunities. Mark was reared in the home of well-to-do parents who had been to college. He was read to as a child, sent to good schools, and given every opportunity to be stimulated intellectually. This environmental difference continued until the twins were in their late teens, when they were given tests to measure their intelligence. Mark's I.Q. was 125, twenty-five points higher than the average and fully forty points higher than his identical brother. Given equal opportunities, the twins, having identical brains, would have tested at roughly the same level.",

Many male birds like the northern cardinal are brightly color1ed to attract females.Bright feathers can be a sign of how healthy the bird is! Female birds are naturally attracted to healthier males because their offspring will be healthier.Female birds are often less colorful. This helps hide them when they are nesting. \nAdvertising color1ation is also used to warn animals away.The ladybug has bright orange wings with black spots.Its color1ing warns meat-eating animals that the ladybug tastes awful. The striped skunk has white stripes that are a warning to meat-eating animals that they may be in for a nasty surprise if they try to attack. \nSome animals,like the red-eyed tree frog,may scare prey away with their color1, Red-eyed tree frogs sleep during the day.If a meat-eating animal comes up to them and they open their eyes,the bright red color1 of their eyes might shock the predator long enough to give the red-eyed flog time to hop away to safety.",

This has been the first obvious increase since 2001.\nAmerican schools last fall had 583,000 foreign students. The record is 586,000. That was set in 2002 after many years of gains. But after that the numbers fell. The terrorist attacks on September 11th, 2001 led to more visa   requirements. Now stronger efforts are being made to get more foreign students to study in the United States.\nChina remained in second place in front of South Korea but behind India, whichsent almost 84,000 students last fall. The number of Japanese fell sharply by nine percent, although it remained in fourth place.\nThere were three percent drops from Indonesia and Kenya, the only African country in the top twenty last year. But there were obvious increases from Saudi Arabia, Nepal and Vietnam. The number of Saudi students more than doubled, rising to nearly eight thousand.\nFor a sixth year, the University of Southern California in Los Angeles had the most foreign students. Columbia University in New York was second. Other schools in the top five were New York University, the University of Illinois and Purdue University.\nUnlike American students in other countries, who often choose history and language study, the leading area of study in the USA was business and management. Second was engineering.\nThe new report also says more than 220,000 Americans studied in other countries. That was during the 2005-2006 school year.

        "question": "How do suppliers meet the requirements of Wal-Mart?",
        "context": "Wal-Mart is not just the world's largest retailer  . It's the world's largest company, which sells in three months what number-two retailer Home Depot sells in a year.\nWal-Mart exercises its power for just one purpose: to bring the lowest possible prices to its customers. At Wal-Mart, that goal is never reached. The retailer has a clear policy for suppliers: On basic products that don't change, the price Wal-Mart will pay, and will charge shoppers, must drop year after year. But what almost no one outside the world of Wal-Mart and none of its 21,000 suppliers know is the high cost of those low prices. To survive in the face of its pricing demands, makers of everything from bikes to jeans have had to close US plants in favor of obtaining products from abroad.\nIndeed, the real story of Wal-Mart, the story that never gets told, is the story of the pressure the biggest retailer constantly applies to its suppliers in the name of bringing us \"every day low prices\".\nThe giant retailer' s low prices often come with a high cost. Wal-Mart' s pressure can crush the companies it does business with and force them to send jobs overseas. Are we shopping our way straight to the unemployment line? Of course, US companies have been moving jobs offshore for decades, long before Wal-Mart was a retailing power. But there is no question that the chain is helping accelerate the loss of American jobs to low-wage countries such as Thailand.\nPeople ask, \"How can it be bad for things to come into the US cheaply?\" Sure, it's great to have bargains. But you can' t buy anything if you' re not employed.\nThere is no question that Wal-Mart's drive to squeeze out cost has benefited consumers. By now, it is accepted wisdom that Wal-Mart makes the companies it does business with more efficient and focused. Wal-Mart itself is known for continuous improvement in its ability to handle, move, and track goods. It is legendary   for forcing its suppliers to redesign everything from their packaging to their computer systems. It is also legendary for quite straightforwardly telling them what it will pay for their goods.",

But its maker, Frito-Lay, thinks otherwise. \"Potato chips are a snack food for the world,\" said Salman Amin, the company's head of global marketing. Amin believes there is no corner of the world that can resist the charms of a Frito-Lay potato chip.\nFrito-Lay is the biggest snack maker in prefix = st1 /Americaowned by PepsiCo and accounts for over half of the parent company's $3 billion annual profits. But theU.S.snack food market is largely saturated, and to grow the company has to look overseas.\nIts strategy rests on two beliefs: first a global product offers economies of scale with which local brands cannot compete. And second, consumers in the 21st century are drawn to \"global\" as a concept. \"Global\" does not mean products that are consciously identified as American, but ones that consumes--especially young people are linked across cultures by shared beliefs and tastes. Potato chips are an American invention, but most Chinese, for instance, do not know that Frito-Lay is an American company. Instead, Riskey, the company's research and development head, would hope they associate the brand with the new world of global communications and business.\nWith brand perception a crucial  factor, Riskey ordered a redesign of the Frito-Lay logo .The logo, along with the company's long-held marketing image of the \"irresistibility\" of its chips would help facilitate the company's global expansion.\nThe executives acknowledge that they try to swing national eating habits to a food created in America, but they deny that amounts to economic imperialism . Rather, they see Frito-Lay as spreading the benefits of free enterprise across the world. \"We're making products in those countries, we're adapting them to the tastes of those countries, building businesses and employing people and changing lives,\" said Steve Reinemund, PepsiCo's chief executive.",

        "context": "Bernie was smart and wanted to be his own boss.When Bernie was 25 he took a wife. Bernie had saved some money and decided on a dry goods and grocery store combined.\n              Marie had a knack for arranging the merchandise to appeal to customers and Bernie didn't mind the long hours. He was happy, and life was good.The business thrived until the great depression hit the entire country. No one had money to purchase pretty things or even food. In 1930, Marie had a heart attack and left Bernie alone. \n              Following Marie's death, which Bernie felt was brought about from worrying about the store, He lost interest in everything. He had few customers and did not make them feel welcome, Bernie wandered about the store , dusting a bit and sweeping the floor. His inventory remained almost the same, as nothing much was sold .A deep depressing set in. He had lost Marie , his true love , and now his business seemed lost as well, Why did he want to live ?\n              A few houses down the street lived a family who had also fallen on hard times. They seldom had three meals a day. Julie , the youngest girl, was fourteen . Julie worried about Mr. Mears' getting so thin. At meal time, she would take a portion of their meal to Bernie. She would stay and talk to him, dusting and cleaning . \n              After several months Bernie began to improve. He still had no customers to speak of, but from what he had left in the stor , he would sack a few cans to take to Julie's family. \n              In early spring, Julie saw her father planting a garden. This gave her an idea. She suggested Bernie making a garden in the big space beside the store, which they had once thought would become a parking lot , and sell the produce really cheap in the store. It would help the neighbors and also Bernie to have money for new merchandise. They would plant half the garden space now and half in three weeks giving them fresh produce for a long time . \n              Julie prayed hard as they placed the seeds in the ground. When the seeds sprouted, Julie looked anxiously at the rows and there were no empty spots. They all came up and produced the best crop of vegetables Bernie had ever seen. They soon became well-known in the community for having the best prices and finest produce in town . They also extended credit to their neighbors and accepted various items as trade for merchandise.\n              The two of them worked hard throughout the 1930s and made a very successful business. Julie earned a salary . As the economy picked up, so did sales at the store.",

The tree blocked the view and made the office seem dull, unfortunately this happened to be the room assigned to me and I was depressed by it for quite some time.\n When the first spring came, everything was green except the locust tree. Secretly, I was very happy because I had thought it had died.\n One morning when I opened the window for fresh air, I unexpectedly smelt a familiar sweet scent floating into my office but I couldn't name it. Suddenly, I realized it was the locust tree! The tree that I thought dead was blossoming in full glory.\n From then on, I usually came to the office very early to see dew forming on the locust tree blossoms and every year was eager to see spring again.\n During summer, the green leaves provided shade protecting me from the harsh sunlight, but allowing enough light in to make it pleasant. In autumn, the leaves turned into many different color1s. Its beauty touched my soul. Many times I thought to take photos but never did. Then I had to leave in a hurry. Later in life it became a great regret that I had not done so.\n Actually, many times in our lives, we think we own something, therefore we don't cherish it. We don't feel regretful until we lose it one day! Moreover, sometimes, we have to accept the things we don't want and need to discover the hidden beauty to find unexpected joy!",

        "context": "When, after a year of being alone on his island, Robinson Crusoe sees a footprint in the sand, the reader of Robinson Crusoe trembles. Will Crusoe find another human being to end his loneliness? Is the footprint the sign of an enemy? Since 1719, when Daniel Defoe wrote Robinson Crusoe, thousands of people who enjoy English novels have thrilled to this great adventure story. But few know how the story came to be written. Robinson Crusoe was the first English novel. Its birth brought together the misadventures of a Scotch \"failure\" and the untapped imagination of an aging English scribbler.\n     Near the end of the Seventeenth Century, the hot-tempered Alexander Selkirk was charged with bad conduct while in church. Rather than face this charge, he ran away to sea. Several years later, Selkirk found himself on the ship of an English privateer. The privateer was preying on Spanish shipping. But Selkirk quarreled bitterly with the Captain. So, when the ship came to the island of Juan Femandez in the South Seas, Selkirk asked to be put ashore. When he saw that there were no people on the island, he begged to be taken back on board. But the Captain refused--Selkirk had gone too far. Over four years later, Selkirk was rescued by another ship.\nWhen Selkirk got back to England, the story of his life on the island fired the imagination of Daniel Defoe. Defoe had been earning a living by his pen since he was thirty. He was amazingly hard-working. He wrote a whole newspaper three times a week. He also made part of his living from politics. He supported both political parties. He told each party that it had his sole support.\nDefoe's morals were weak. But he was a fine writer. He was almost sixty when, in the midst of his work in politics, he wrote Robinson Crusoe. In it, Defoe--said one critic--\"forged  a story, and forced it on the world for truth.\" The detail of Crusoe's battle for survival on a lonely island is so vivid that the reader of Robinson Crusoe accepts the product of the author's imagination for reality.

        "context": "My mom has eyes in the back of her head. She also taught me from an early age to be suspicious of strange men, especially when they give you presents. One day, a \"nice man\" bearing flowers managed to steal 20 euros from her purse, while she was holding it in her hands. \"He said he was collecting for a church charity so I pulled out a euro,\" she explains, \"He said 'no, no, that's too much' and offered to look in my purse to find a smaller coin. He must have slid out that 20 euro note at the same time. I did not even notice until an hour later. I felt so stupid.\"\nAccording to neuroscientists, the key requirement for a successful pickpocket is not having nifty   fingers, it's having a working knowledge of the loopholes   in our brain. The most important of these loopholes is the fact that our brains are not set up to multi-task. Most of the time that is a good thing -- _ allows us to filter   out all but the most important features of the world around us. But a good trickster can use it to against you. This kind of trick involves capturing all of somebody's attention with other movements. Street pickpockets often use this effect to their advantage by manufacturing a situation that can not help but overload your attention system. Other strategies are more psychological. Pickpockets tend to hang out a \"beware of pickpockets\" signs, because the first thing people do when they read it is check they still have their valuables, helpfully giving away where they are. And in my mom's case, the thief's best trick was not coming across like a pickpocket. \"He was a very nice guy and very confident. Not someone that would cause you to suspect,\" she says. Apollo Robbins, a stage pickpocket, said smart move, like moving your hand in an arc   motion rather than a straight line, is another popular strategy employed by tricksters.\nAt last, it should be pointed out that most thefts are opportunistic. The skill level of most thieves is far less than you think. But they are opportunistic enough to keep up with new technology.",

        "context": "For most of us, the rain that falls on our roof runs off into the ground or the sewer  system. But if you want to save a little water and reuse it on your lawns or plants --- or even use it for laundry, dishes, or other needs --- collecting rainwater from your gutter's downspouts  is a _ \nAccording to John C. Davis, writing in E / The Environmental Magazine, just about any homeowner can collect rainwater, given that the roof and gutters do most of the work. And since an inch of rain falling on a 2,000-square-foot roof produces some 1,200 gallons of water, you can harvest enough to water your lawn or garden.\nPlants and grass actually do better when fed rainwater instead of tap water, which is usually treated with substances that can hold back plant growth. Using rainwater can also extend the life of pipes, since the salts added to tap water may gradually damage the pipes. However, homeowners should set up a water purification system if they do plan to use rainwater for inside needs.\nRainwater harvesting can also be good for the local community, as it reduces the erosion, flooding, and pollution associated with heavy rainfall, and reduces dependence on public water supplies. So some states fund rainwater collection systems in their local communities.\nMany varieties of rain barrel  systems, starting at just $100, are available for home use. A typical setup is simply a rain barrel positioned under a gutter's downspout. Skillful homeowners can make their own water harvesting systems, but buying one is a lot easier. Most garden centres offer a range of choices as well as tips.",

Sometimes they try to do something better, faster or longer than anyone else in order to have their names included in the Guinness Book of World Records.\nA lady in Massachusetts may have the world's easiest hobby; she let her hair grow. Diane Witt has not cut her hair for twelve years. It is now eight feet (2.44 meters) long, and she will soon set a new world record and her name will be placed in the Guinness Book. A thirty-year-old man in Pennsylvania played the piano for forty-five days and eleven hours, while a musician in Connecticut played the flute for forty-three hours.\nA teacher in California typed for over 162 hours, and a lady from Iowa spend six years typing the numbers from one to one million. Probably the cleanest people in the world are two young women from England who stayed in the shower for over ninety-eight hours; but a man in Oregon was more than twice as clean after taking a shower that lasted two hundred hours.\nSomeone said that \"records are made to be broken\".

We say, \"Nice song.\" \"Honey, you don't look fat in that, no.\" But another study showed that strangers lied three times within the first 10 minutes of meeting each other. We lie more to strangers than we lie to coworkers. Men lie eight times more about themselves than they do other people. Women lie more to protect other people. If you're married, you're going to lie to your wife/ husband in one out of every 10 communications. If you're unmarried, that number drops to three. But look, if at some point you got lied to, it's because you agreed to get lied to. Truth about lying: lying's a cooperative act. Not all lies are harmful. Sometimes we're willing to lie for the sake of social dignity  , maybe to keep a private secret.\nLying is complex. It's woven into the fabric of our daily and business lives. We're deeply disturbed by the truth. We explain it, sometimes for very good reasons, other times just because we don't understand the gaps between ideals and realities in our lives. We're against lying, but secretly we're for it in ways that our society has practiced for centuries and centuries. It's as old as breathing. It's part of our culture and history. Think the stories from Dante, Shakespeare, the Bible, News of the World.\nLying has great value to the evolution of human being. Researchers have long known that the more intelligent the species, the more likely it is to lie. We human like to become leaders. It starts really early. How early? Well, babies will pretend to cry, pause, wait to see who's coming and then go right back to crying. One-year-olds learn hiding truth. Two-year-olds bluff  . Five-year-olds lie outright and try to control via flattery  . Nine-year-olds, masters of covering up. By the time you enter college, you're going to lie to your mom in one out of every five interactions. By the time we enter this work world to be breadwinners, we've entered a world that is just full of fake digital friends, business media, identity thieves, world-class cheats, ----in short, a post-truth society.\nWhat do you do? Well there are steps we can take to guide our way through the bushes. Trained lie spotters get to the truth 90% of the time. The rest of us, we're only 54% accurate. Why is it so easy to learn? There are clever liars and stupid liars. There're no real original liars. We all make the same mistakes. We all use the same techniques.",

Researchers have studied each of her messages to the Commonwealth countries since 1952 to find out the change in her pronunciation from the noble Upper Received to the Standard Received.\nJonathan Harrington, a professor at Germany's University of Munich, wanted to discover whether accent changes recorded over the past half century would take place within one person. \"As far as I know, there just is nobody else for whom there is this sort of broadcast records,\" he said.\nHe said the noble way of pronouncing vowels  had gradually lost ground as the noble upper-class accent over the past years. \"Her accent sounds slightly less noble than it did 50 years ago. But these are very, very small and slow changes that we don't notice from year to year.\"\n\"We may be able to relate it to changes in the social classes,\" he told The Daily Telegraph, a British  newspaper. \"In 1952 she would have been heard saying 'thet men in the bleck het'. Now it would be 'that man in the black hat'. Similarly, she would have spoken of 'the citay' and'dutay', rather than 'citee' and 'dutee', and 'hame' rather than 'home'. In the 1950s she would have been 'lorst', but by the 1970s 'lost'.\"\nThe Queen's broadcast is a personal message to the Commonwealth countries. Each Christmas, the 10-minute broadcast is put on TV at 3 pm in Britain as many families are recovering from their traditional turkey lunch .\nThe results were published  in the Journal of Phonetics.",

        "context": "Eighteen-year-old Dana Kiger is happily running after balls on the soccer field. But not long ago, she couldn't remember her love of the game, her parents' faces or even her name.\nAt 16, the Tennessee honor student and star athlete was hit from behind while playing in a soccer game. She fell to the ground, her head striking the hard ground. The blow knocked out nearly all of Kiger's memories.\nWith no physical  injury or unusual change in her brain, doctors thought Kiger's memory would return in a few days. But it did not. And two and a half years later, it still hasn't. Kiger--who has no memory of her family, her childhood or her life before her injury--has had to create new memories, restart relationships and relearn old skills.\n\"The only thing I had ...I could walk, write, but I didn't know what to write,\" Kiger said of the days after the accident. \"Physically, I was OK, I guess, but mentally  I was troubled.\" Doctors say long-term amnesia  brought on by a less severe brain injury like Kiger's is unusual. \"It's very rare for people to have this lasting problem with memory recovering,\" said Dr Roger Hartl at Weill Cornell Medical College.\nKiger's parents tried to help their daughter return to the life she once lived. \"She didn't know what food was,\" Kiger's mom said. \"She said, 'What is that?' I said, 'Lettuce.\" She said, 'Do I like it?' I said, 'That's up to you to decide.'\"\nKiger's natural ability on the soccer field was the one part of her earlier life that died immediately. And soon, she'll begin a new life at Slippery Rock University, where she plans to study physical therapy . Kiger said that while parts of her past still remain a mystery, she's focused  on what's to come. \"It is about my future,\" she said.",

That game and others that promote large consumption will be banned from April and publicans   will have to ensure free tap water is made available to the drinkers.\nThe government says over-drinking costs Britain up to 12 billion pounds a year and has announced that any pubs that go against the new mandatory code   will face severe punishment.

On the same day, a Nepali   man, Apa Sherpa, broke his own world record of climbing Everest when he reached the summit for the twentieth time. Apa Shepa's team set off from Nepal's capital, Kathmandu, last month, heading for the base camp on the Chinese side of the mountain.\n\"The team has just called in and believe that they are standing on top of Mt. Everest,\" Romero's blog said. \"Their dreams have now come true. Everyone is happy.\"\nThe climbing has put Romero one step closer to reaching his goal of climbing the highest mountains on all seven continents  . \"It is just a goal.\" Romero said. He had already climbed five peaks  , and needs to climb only Vinson Massif, the highest peak in Antarctica, to hit his goal.\nThe youngest person before to climb Everest was 16-year-old Temba Tsheri Sherpa of Nepal. Romero climbed together with a team including his father Paul and three local guides. He wanted to pick a small piece of rock from the top of the world and wear it in a necklace. While Nepal insists that anyone planning to climb Mount Everest must be at least 16, China does not have any age restrictions  . Some mountain climbers haven't agreed with the Romero family for letting him try it but his father said the climbing from the Chinese side is less dangerous.",

Nothing.\nWe were not completely uninterested in culture.But this was a first holiday without parents,as it was for most other Inter-Railers,and in organizing our own timetable  we left out everything except the most available sights.This was the chance to escape the guided tour,an opportunity to do something different.I took great pride in the fact that.in many places,all I could be bothered to see was the view from the station.We were just there to get by,and to have good time doing so.In this we were not different from most of the other Inter-Raiders with whom we shared passage  floors,food and water,money and music.\nThe excitement of travel comes from the sudden reality of somewhere that was previously just a name.It is as if the city in which you arrive never actually existed until the train pulls in at the station and you are able to see it with your own tired eyes for the first time.",

She was just ready to go downstairs when she found that her Spanish money wasn't in her handbag. She carefully looked in all her luggage, but she couldn't find it. All she had was a small purse with ten English pound notes in it! \nAnn found a place to change her English money. She had very few pesetas  , and she would be here for two weeks. On her way back to the hotel, Ann bought some cheese, some bread and some oranges. When she got back, she told the manager that her doctor had told her not to eat Spanish food; she'd just have breakfast each day. That was all right, as she knew the price of hotels included breakfast.\nFor the rest of her holiday, Ann swam in the hotel swimming pool, or lay on the beach and got a sunbath. When the other tourists went to interesting places, she always said she wasn't well. In fact, her holiday wasn't bad, except that she was always hungry. After all, a piece of fruit for lunch, and bread and cheese for supper isn't very much.\nLate in the afternoon of their last day, a girl, Jane, asked her why she never ate with them in the hotel restaurant. Ann told her about her money problems. Jane looked at her for a minute, and then said, \"But didn't you know? The price of this holiday includes everything!\"",

        "context": "Why texting harms your IQ\nThe regular use of text messages and e-mails can lower the IQ more than twice as much as smoking marijuana  . That is the statement of researchers who have found that tapping away on a mobile phone or computer keypad or checking for electronic messages temporarily knocks up to 10 points off the user's IQ. This rate of decline in intelligence compares unfavorably with the four-point drop in IQ associated with smoking marijuana, according to British researchers, who have described the phenomenon of improved stupidity as \"infomania\". The research conducted by Hewlett Packard, the technology company, has concluded that it is mainly a problem for adult workers, especially men.\nIt is concluded that too much use of modern technology can damage a person's mind. It can cause a constant distraction of \"always on\" technology when employees should be concentrating on what they are paid to do. Infomania means that they lose concentration as their minds remain fixed in an almost permanent state of readiness to react to technology instead of focusing on the task in hand. The report also added that, in a long term, the brain will be considerably shaped by what we do to it and by the experience of daily life. At a microcellular level, the complex networks of nerve cells that make up parts of the brain actually change in response to certain experiences.\nToo much use of modern technology can be damaging not only to a person's mind, but to their social relationship. 1100 adults were interviewed during the research. More than 62 per cent of them admitted that they were addicted to checking their e-mails and text messages so often that they _ work-related ones even when at home or on holiday. Half said that they always responded immediately to an email and will even interrupt a meeting to do so. It is concluded that infomania is increasing stress and anxiety and affecting one's characteristics. Nine out of ten thought that colleagues who answered e-mails or messages during a face-to-face meeting were extremely rude.\nThe effects on IQ were studied by Dr Glenn Wilson, a psychologist at University of London. \"This is a very real and widespread phenomenon,\" he said. \"We have found that infomania will damage a worker's performance by reducing their mental sharpness and changing their social life. Companies should encourage a more balanced and appropriate way of working.\"",

Early estimates  from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) show that 963 million people did not get enough to eat.\nWorld food prices have dropped since early 2008. Prices of major crops have decreased by more than half from their height earlier last year. But they remain high compared to earlier years.\nBut FAO official Hafez Ghanem says lower prices have failed to end the food crisis   in many poor countries. \"For millions in developing countries,\" he says, \"getting enough food every day to live an active and healthy life is a distant dream.\"\nThe FAO says food shortage is a threat to people's health. Today, two-thirds of the world's _ people live in just a few countries. These are India, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Pakistan, Ethiopia and so on.\nA report on food insecurity warns that the current economic crisis could send even more people into hunger and poverty.\nIn sub-Saharan Africa, the percentage of the people who continually go hungry fell from 34% in 1997 to 30% in 2008. But the FAO says Ghana is the only country that has reached two sets of hunger reduction targets. These were set by the 1996 World Food Summit and the Millennium Development Goals. The main reason is the growth in agricultural production in Ghana.\nThe FAO says some countries in Southeast Asia like Thailand and Vietnam have made progress in hunger reduction goals.

There are some benefits of course, as people who are breaking laws can be watched and caught using cameras and this helps keep our society and public places safe. These cameras are everywhere and most are openly visible on roads, in airports, businesses, shopping centers and government buildings and even in lifts. Even schools have started using spy cams to watch student activity and behaviour.\nThe cameras are so common now that we hardly ever even notice them. But the problem lies with the ones that are hidden away from our eyes and are unseen. Technology has helped develop tiny cameras that can be very well hidden and they can \"spy\" on shoppers, workers, babysitters and people in hotels and clubs without the people even knowing.\nIt is these spy cams that people feel are an invasion of privacy. Recently, in the US, there have been a number of court cases against babysitters whose actions have been recorded by their employers on hidden cameras.\nThe number of cameras in public and private areas is on the increase and with rising crime rates and the recent terrorist attacks, more and more surveillance cameras are being used to watch us. This means that we all have to be aware that our employers, department stores, police and even some of our friends could be spying on us at any time!",

It is a good exercise, yet many people find it boring. But what if making your morning jog a creative one?Like jumping from walls and over gaps and ground rolls? Just like the James Bond in the movie Casino Royale? Bond jumps down from a roof to a windowsill and then runs several blocks over _ on the way. It is just because of Bond's wonderful performances that the sport has become popular worldwide.\nYes, that's parkour, an extreme street sport aimed at moving from one point to another as quickly as possible, getting over all the obstacles in the path using only the abilities of the human body. Parkour is considered an extreme sport. As its participants dash around a city, they may jump over fences, run up walls and even move from rooftop to rooftop.\nParkour can be just as exciting and charming as it sounds,but its participants see parkour much more than that.\nOvercoming all the obstacles on the course and in life is part of the philosophy   behind parkour. This is the same as life. You must determine your destination, go straight, and jump over all the barriers as if in parkour and never fall back from them in your life, to reach the destination successfully. A parkour lover said,\"I love parkour because its philosophy has become my life, my way to do everything.\"\nAnother philosophy we've learnt from parkour is freedom. It can be done by anyone, at any time, anywhere in the world. It is a kind of expression of trust in yourself that you earn energy and confidence.",

They also elected the town's officials at these gatherings and made decisions about the taxes they would pay and about other community matters. These meetings were usually held at the town hall, which was located in the central square.\nIn the eighteenth-century town meetings, only men who owned property and who were church members actually voted, although everyone present was allowed to express their opinions. Later, all citizens were allowed to vote. Thus the town meeting became truly democratic. Town meetings are still common in New England communities.\nIn recent years the town meeting idea has been widely imitated. There are open sessions of this kind on radio and television.

Time is not our problems , but what we do with the limited time we have is the issue.

The Pareto Principle, also known as the 80:20 Rule shows us that typically eighty per cent of unfocused effort generates only twenty percent of the results. The remaining eighty per cent of the results are achieved with only twenty percent of the effort . To effectively manage your time, you need to change where you are spending your time. We all have the same amount of time every day. How you spend your time is how you spend your life. Here are time management strategies, which may be helpful.\nLearn to say no\nPolitely say no should become a habit. Saying no frees up time for the things that are most important.\nMake a \"to-do\" list\n   List the tasks that need to be done in order of their importance. Save other less important things for when you have time.\nMinimize interruption\nPlan ahead. Think through projects. Look for ways to  _ interruptions. For example, close your door, don't answer the phone or work in a different space.\nCombine several activities\n   Try to do several activities at one time. While going to school,listen to taped notes. This allows up to an hour or two a day of good study review. While showering,make a mental list of the things.

If you ever visit Mexico, you will see that the people there take begging as nothing to get upset about and nothing to get embarrassed by.\nSo, this little boy came to the door, a boy about the same age as my student's son.

But the father, like a big tiger in a way, insisted gently, \"No, you must give him one of your favorite toys.\"\nAnd finally the boy, with his head down, picked up a toy he had just gotten. The father waited in the living room, and the boy walked to the front door with the toy in his hand. The father waited and waited.\nWhat do you think happened?\nAfter a couple of minutes, his son came running back into the living room, his face radiant  . \"Daddy,\" he said, \"can I do that again?\"\nI think I have got the answer to the question.",

        "question": "From the passage, the father was  _   in the writer's memory.",
        "context": "Occasionally, my father came back drunk. Late at night, he beat on the door, pleading to my mother to open it .He was on his way home from drinking, gambling, or some combination thereof, misspending money that we could have used and wasting time that we desperately needed.\nIt was the late-1970s. My parents were separated. My mother was now raising a group of boys on her own. My father spouted off about what he planned to do for us, buy for us.In fact, he had no intention of doing anything. As a father who was supposed to love us, in fact, he lacked the understanding of what it truly meant to love a child--or to hurt one. To him, this was a harmless game that kept us excited and begging. In fact, it was a cruel, corrosive lie. I lost faith in his words and in him. I wanted to stop caring, but I couldn't.\nMaybe it was his own complicated relationship to his father and his father's family that caused him cold. Maybe it was the pain and guilt associated with a life of misfortune. Who knows. Whatever it was, it stole him from us, and particularly from me.\nWhile my brothers talked about breaking and fixing things, I spent many of my evenings reading and wondering. My favorite books were a set of encyclopedias  given by my uncle. They allowed me to explore the world beyond my world, to travel without leaving, to dream dreams greater than my life would otherwise have supported. But losing myself in my own mind also meant that I was completely lost to my father. Not understanding me, he simply ignored me--not just emotionally, but physically as well. Never once did he hug me, never once a pat on the back or a hand on the shoulder or a tousling of the hair.\nMy best memories of him were from his episodic attempts at engagement with us. During the longest of these episodes , once every month or two, he would come pick us up and drive us down the interstate to Trucker's Paradise, a seedy, smoke-filled, truck stop with gas pumps, a convenience store, a small dining area and a game room through a door in the back. My dad gave each of us a handful of quarters, and we played until they were gone. He sat up front in the dining area, drinking coffee and being particular about the restaurant's measly offerings.\nI loved these days. To me, Trucker's Paradise was paradise. The quarters and the games were fun but easily forgotten. It was the presence of my father that was most treasured. But, of course, these trips were short-lived.\nIt wasn't until I was much older that I would find something that I would be able to _ as evidence of my father's love.\nWhen the Commodore 64 personal computer debuted, I convinced myself that I had to have it even though its price was out of my mother's range. So I decided to earn the money myself. I mowed every yard I could find that summer for a few dollars each, yet it still wasn't enough. So my dad agreed to help me raise the rest of the money by driving me to one of the watermelon farms south of town, loading up his truck with wholesale melons and driving me around to sell them. He came for me before daybreak. We made small talk, but it didn't matter. The fact that he was talking to me was all that mattered. I was a teenager by then, but this was the first time that I had ever spent time alone with him. He laughed and repeatedly introduced me as \"my boy,\" a phrase he relayed with a sense of pride. It was one of the best days of my life.\nAlthough he had never told me that he loved me, I would _ that day as the greatest evidence of that fact. He had never intended me any wrong. He just didn't know how to love me right. He wasn't a mean man. So I took these random episodes and _ them like a thing most precious, storing them in my mind for the long stretches of coldness when a warm memory would prove most useful.\nIt just goes to show that no matter how friendless the father, no matter how deep the damage, no matter how shattered the bond, there is still time, still space, still a need for even the smallest bit of evidence of a father's love.\n\"My boy.\"",

This homemade, creamy treat is a summertime delight for your kids and you alike.\nWhat you'll need:\n1 tablespoon of sugar; 1/2 cup of milk; 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla  ; 6 tablespoons of rock salt; 1 small-sized plastic food storage bag; 1 gallon-sized plastic food storage bag; ice cubes.\nHow to make it:\nl Fill the large bag half full of ice, and add the rock salt. Seal the bag.\nl Put milk, vanilla, and sugar into the small bag, and seal it.\nl Place the small bag inside the large one, and seal it again carefully.\nl Shake until the mixture turns into ice cream, which takes about five minutes.\nl Wipe the top of the small bag, and then open it carefully. Enjoy!\nTips:\n1/2 cup of milk will make about one spoon of ice cream, so double the recipe if you want more. But don't increase the amount more than _ --a large amount might be too big for kids to pick up because the ice itself is heavy.\nHere is another version of the homemade ice cream recipe from another parent!\nThese are the homemade ice cream ingredients:\n1/4 teaspoon of vanilla butter and nuts; 1 tablespoon of sugar; 1/2 cup of milk.\nThese are the other supplies:\nPlastic sandwich bag; 12 salt pellets; 1 dish of ice; large plastic bag.\nPut the ice cream ingredients in the small bag, and then put the bag, salt and ice in the big bag. Hold the bag shut and move it around on the floor for about 5 minutes.\nWhen I made ice cream at home last time, although the salt pellets didn't really dissolve   that well, I still got ice cream. It was not smooth ice cream, probably because of the low-fat milk. It was incredible that it could be ready in 5 minutes (not counting preparing the ingredients)\nNext, I changed the recipe, using a tablespoon of cocoa, a tablespoon of sugar, and a cup of milk. It was a bit too chocolaty, but good!",

        "context": "Some children are natural-born bosses. They have a strong need to make decisions, manage their environment, and lead rather than follow. Stephen Jackson, a Year One student, \"operates under the theory of what's mine is mine and what's yours is mine,\" says his mother. \"The other day I bought two new Star Wars light sabers . Later, I saw Stephen with the two new ones while his brother was using the beat-up ones. \"\n\"Examine the extended family, and you'll probably find a bossy grandparent, aunt, uncle or cousin in every generation. It's an inheritable trait,\" says Russell Barkley, a professor at the Medical University of South Carolina. Other children who may not be particularly bossy can gradually gain dominance when they sense their parents are weak, hesitant, or in disagreement with each other.\nWhether it's inborn nature or developed character at work, too much control in the hands of the young isn't healthy for children or the family, Fear is at the root of a lot of bossy behavior, says family psychologist John Taylor. Children, he says in his book From Defiance to Cooperation, \"have secret feelings of weakness\" and \"a desire to feel safe. \" It's the parents' role to provide that protection.\nWhen a \"boss child\" doesn't learn limits at home, the stage is set for a host of troubles outside the family. The overly willful and unbending child may have trouble obeying teachers or coaches, for example, or trouble keeping friends. It can be pretty lonely as the top dog if no one likes your bossy ways.\n\"I see more and more parents giving up their power,\" says Barkley, who has studied bossy behavior for more than 30 years. \"They bend too far because they don't want to be as strict as their own parents were. But they also feel less confident about their parenting skills. Their kids, in turn, feel more anxious. \"",

Communication is key to any friendship. Open your mouth and let your dad know what's on your mind. Give him a chance to get to know you.\nListen up. Your dad's lived more life than you have. Believe it or not, he's probably been there and can help you get through the pressures and struggles. Ask how he dealt with school, girls or temptations  . Then pay attention.\nTake some time. It can be hard for us kids to talk about what really matters. But spending time together can build the relationship, and create chances to talk. Go for a hike or a game. Work on the car. Whatever you're into, ask your dad to do it together.\nFight fair. Family disagreements are unavoidable.  _ , keep your mouth respectful and cool off before you say something bad. Talk it out when you can do so calmly.\nRealize respect. Face it: your dad's been given authority   to help guide you as you know. He's going to make mistakes, but so are you.

Sun Pictures was built in 1916 on the other side of the globe from Hollywood. All the big films were shipped here and the lonely country was amazed.\nBroome resident Pearl Hamaguchi has never traveled far from home.

That's why it's always a good idea to shake out your chair to make sure there are no spiders or scorpions.\n\"We've only had a couple of scorpion incidents but no one's been stung yet,\" said Aaron Mestemaker, a tourist visiting from Michigan.\nSun Pictures is a holy hall of movie history and a reminder that air conditioning and carpet are no match for grass and fresh air---even when the lizards steal the scene.",

The USA National Committee to Prevent Child Abuse finds 3 million new reports of child abuse or neglect every year.\nAccording to such information on human rights abuses of children, the United Nations declared 2010 as the International Year of Youth. In answer to the common human rights abuses of young people, Dr. Mary Shuttleworth of Youth for Human Rights International(YHRI) recently completed her seventh annual World Tour to five continents in eighty days. The purpose of the tour is to promote the\nto tens of thousands of children and officials.\nAccording to UNICEF, 1.2 million children are illegally traded all over the world every year.\nSold as goods, these children are forced into inhuman labor, denied basic education and robbed of their childhoods. Youth who do not know their rights are easily cheated by ill-intentioned men. That is why YHRI thinks highly of education.\n\"When the United Nations declared 2010 as the International Year of Youth, I knew that their human rights had to be greater than ever,\" Dr. Shuttleworth said. The tour reached Mexico, Guatemala, Panama, Ecuador, Brazil, South Africa, Swaziland, Portugal, Sardinia, Sicily, Italy, Greece, Taiwan, Japan, Hawaii and Los Angeles.\nThe YHRI World Tour 2010 has reached tens of thousands of students as well as officials, educators, and religious leaders and thus promotes human rights education to millions more.",

And, as you speed along the road, you might also think of ways in which you could improve your bike-- make it safer, more efficient, or more comfortable. In fact, the two-wheeled machines make for some cool science projects.\nThis year's Intel International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF), held last May in Cleveland, featured(had)three bicycle projects from three countries. Like many of the other experiments presented at ISEF, the bike projects showed that some of the most interesting scientific research often begins by taking a closer look at things you care about.\nRenato Angulo Chu had even grander ambitions. The 12th-grader from Lima, Peru, wanted to _ some of his country's economic troubles.\n\"I see a problem in my country,\" Renato said. \"If you go to the forests in Peru, in some places you cannot find electricity. If you go with my bicycle, you can turn on the lights.\"\nRenato, 16, spent 3 years designing his special Multibike. The device looks like a fixed exercise bike. It has wires fixed along the frame and a blender strapped (fastened) to the back. Turning the pedals operates the blender. The same principle can be used to sharpen knives or sweep city streets.\nThe Multibike can work either as a fixed bike or as a bicycle able to travel city streets and country roads. It's made from inexpensive materials, and the user gets exercise while pedaling to operate a machine.\n\"You pedal the bike, and you can mix any drink you want,\" Renato said. More importantly, he added, the same concept could be used to bring light to houses in remote regions of the rainforest.",

It is located in the Bolivar state in Venezuela. A unique feature of the falls is that most of the water falling down gets blown away by the winds as mist . The fallen water flows away as the Churun River.\nTugela Falls-This is the world's second highest waterfalls and it falls from a height of 947 meters. It is located in the Natal Province in South Africa. The source of the Falls, the Tugela River, is a finally pure river and is considered safe for drinking. The specialty of this waterfalls is the presence of a series of five spectacular waterfalls.\nNiagara Falls-The Niagara Falls is one of the most powerful waterfalls in the world with about six million cubic meters of water flowing per minute. It is present in the Canada-America border and consists of a set of waterfalls named the American Falls, Bridal Veil Falls and the Horseshoe Falls. It is well-known for its beauty and attracts a large number of tourists around the world.\nRhine Falls-The Rhine Falls is the largest waterfalls in Europe.

I enjoyed answering their various strange questions. I made a lot of friends and I started to hang out with them.\nOf course, there were a number of new things, and it took me the whole year to find them all out. I never got homesick. Perhaps it was because I did not have too many negative experiences and felt loved and welcomed there.\nHowever, I had _ some painful experience back in Germany. I was frustrated by the way people would run me over and not even say \"Sorry.\" Taking up my studies at the TU-Dresden, I felt lonely. Everybody here seemed to be withdrawn  and I missed everything I had in Cincinnati. Germany was so \"cold\". I found it so much harder to make new friends. After six months I got a roommate and only two good friends. I also flew back to Cincinnati several times for long periods. I felt that without those visits I was not able to make it.\nNow I am over this German culture shock. It almost took me an entire year. I am still going back and forward between Dresden and Cincinnati four times a year.",

The idea was to reunite Europe after the Second World War.\nAt the same time, the \"Fringe\" appeared as a challenge to the official festival.Eight theatre groups turned up uninvited in 1947,in the belief that everyone should have the right to perform,and they did so in a public house disused for years.\nSoon,groups of studentsfirstly from Edinburgh University, and later from the universities of Oxford and Cambridge,Durham and Birmingham were making the journey to the Scottish capital each summer to perform theatre by little-known writers of plays in small church halls to the people of Edinburgh.\nToday the \"Fringe\",once less recognized, has far outgrown the festival with around 1,500 performances of theatre,music and dance on every one of the 21 days it lasts. And yet as early as 1959,with only 19 theatre groups performing,some said it was getting too big.\nA paid administrator was first employed only in 1971, and today there are eight administrators working all year round and the number rises to 150 during August itself.

It occurred to me that this may not be the most dignified posture for a Buddhist nun .\nI had seen the old lady from the seat in front of me as she walked up and down the passage with a flashlight. I asked a few times what was wrong, but she didn't answer at first --- she couldn't hear me. She was wearing a woolen coat. Judging from her accent, she came from Eastern Europe.\nDo you know what hearing aids cost? Thousands, especially for the new tiny hidden-in-the-ear type she described. It takes a long time for an appointment to make a new one, and many doctor visits to get the thing adjusted right. Therefore, my dignity seemed less important than finding that hearing aid. But how does one find a tiny black object in a shadowy jet cabin ?\nThe lady wasn't even sure where or when she had lost it. At one point, a couple of flight attendants did a random search around the lady's seat; I wasn't impressed. They left suggesting that she search the seat of her previous flight! My flashlight turned up all kinds of small objects, bits of plastic, broken pieces of headphones.\nThe old lady said that she gave up. Yet I couldn't. After we landed, as passengers streamed past us, I insisted that the lady move aside while awaiting her wheelchair. Then I got into a real down and dirty search among the dust under her seat and on the floor.\nLook! A little peanut-sized shiny black object caught the light of my flashlight in a floor crack near her seat.\nWhat a rush. \"I found it!\"\nWith great astonishment and gratitude, the old lady responded, \"I haven't the words to express my thanks!\"",

I hoped they would feel happy and warm when reading my letter.\" Many of Zhai' s classmates also wrote their words of encouragement and admiration to the astronauts. \"The letter to the astronauts made us believe that we can also be part of the manned space programme,\" said Zhao Dongxu.\n    All the students have high expectations for China' s future space programme. \"I heard that Snoopy is the mascot   for US astronauts. I hope I can design a mascot for our heroes,\" said Liu Mengjie, 16. \"A physics class taught by astronauts in outer space would be very interesting.

        "context": "One day about 30 years ago, a 2 year-old Chinese boy in Shenyang was watching a Tom and Jerry cartoon on TV. Tom the cat began to play the piano. The music was to beautiful that the boy fell in love with it at once. This little boy was Lang Lang - one of today's great pianists.\nLang Lang began to play the piano at 3. By the age of 5, the had won fist place in Shenyang's piano competition and performed his first public recital . People were shocked by his perfect performance and thought he was a real talent. From that time on, playing on the global stage became the dream of Lang Lang and his parents.\nTo help him much closer to his dream, when Lang was 9, his father quit his job and went with Lang to Beijing to help his son study piano. There, Lang did not receive the praise that he had received at home, and he experienced the hardest time of his life.   \"I was kicked out of the class by my piano teacher six months later. It totally destroyed my piano dream,\" Lang said in an interview. Hearing of his son's failure, Lang's father was so angry and upset that told Lang Lang to go back to Shenyang. Feeling hopeless and in pain, Lang tried to damage his fingers. He hated piano!\nLuckily, another teacher noticed Lang's sadness and encouraged him. Success came soon. Lang's breakthrough came at age 17, when he gained worldwide fame at a well-known concert in 1999 in Chicago, US.",

        "context": "When 15-year-old Louisa Ball takes a nap, she sleeps for days on end, and no amount of shaking can fully wake her up. The British girl has a rare condition called Sleeping Beauty Sickness. Doctors don't know what causes it or how to cure it --only know that it strikes teenagers and goes away by itself after eight to 12 years.\nLouisa's mum, Lottie, told NBC News that the girl had flulike symptoms just over a year ago. Shortly afterward, she had her first period of long sleeping.\nShe was eventually diagnosed with Kleine-Levin Syndrome, whose victims worldwide may number no more than 1,000. The victims live normally for weeks or months at a time, with normal sleep patterns and normal energy levels. Then, with little warning, they'll go to sleep for days or weeks at a time. So far, Louisa's longest period in bed has been 13 days. Victims will wake briefly, but be _ and not fully awake. Louisa's parents force her awake so she can use the bathroom and eat.\nNow, Louisa's friends can tell when a period is coming on. She stops talking and she may be annoyed easily. That's when she knows she has to get home to her bed. Louisa has slept through family vacations, the dance recitals  she loves to perform in, and school tests. Now it becomes increasingly difficult to catch up on missed schoolwork.\nBut just as doctors don't know the cause, they also don't know why it ends as mysteriously as it began. The illness is unrelated to narcolepsy , whose victims are constantly tired and drop off for brief periods of sleep at any time.\nIt's so dramatic that some people have accused Louisa of making the false symptoms to get attention. Her father, Richard, thinks that's absurd.",

        "context": "When I opened my e-mail the other day, a pretty woman named Rachel appeared on my computer screen. She greeted me by name and started talking with great enthusiasm . Every now and then she stopped to smile at me or blow a kiss. She was reading to me an e-mail from my brother, and a lot of it was about the trouble he had getting the phone company to give him a high-speed Internet connection. It was pretty cool.\nRachel was there thanks to a new technology called Facemail. An ace man lets you send an e-mail that gets ready to the recipient by an attractive male or female from or by a clown . The software, which is free, can be downloaded at www.facemail.com.\nFacemail faces are lifelike, and they simulate emotions based on emotions-for example, that you put in your text. Type in; -x, and Rachel blows a kiss.\nLife Fx, the company that develops the Facemail, is sure there are broad business uses. The reason e-business is not popular, the company says, is that buying over the Internet lacks the human touch. But what if you went to the Nike website and Michel Jordan greeted you by name, waited on you and personally closed the sale? And it is talking with Whirlpool about using the technology in a computer screen on a fridge. Then if Mom can't be home when the kids get back from school, she can leave a note with voice and image telling them what there is to eat. Facemail could get hot fast. Personally, I'm a fan. But Facemail should be used with care. The clown looks lively and funny at first. But if you select the clown, put a few rude words in an e-mail and add some angry emotions, you're got Psycho-mail .",

The genius went to a grammar school when he was only 6 years old and graduated just within 7 months. At the age of 11, he became the youngest student of the Harvard University. He graduated with high scores at the age of 16 and entered Harvard Law School at 18.\n    Gifted with an amazing IQ between 220 and 230, Terence Tao makes it to this list of the people with the highest IQ in the world. Born in Adelaide, Australia in 1975, this genius first displayed his incredible intelligence at a mere age of 2, when he managed to solve basic arithmetic questions on his own. At the age of 16, he graduated with both Master's and Bachelor's degrees at the Flinders University. He has been considered as ''Mr. Fix it \" by Charles Fefferman, who is a professor of Mathematics at Princeton University, and many other mathematicians want to interest him in their problems.\n    This 31-year-old Japanese-American astrophysicist lands him third in this list. At the age of 12, Christopher Hirata already worked on college-level courses, around the time most of us were just in the 7th grade. At the age of 13, this gifted kid became the youngest American to have ever won the gold medal in the International physics Olympiad.\nAt the age of 16, he was already working with NASA on its project to conquer planet Mars. After he was awarded the Ph.D. at Princeton University, he went back to California Institute of Technology.\n    The next person with very high IQ is Albert Einstein. With an IQ between 160 and 190, Albert Einstein is the genius behind the theory of relativity, which has had great impact on the world of science. He possessed such an amazing ability that after his death, researchers were eager to preserve and make research on his brain in search for clues to his exceptional brilliance, which to this day, has remained a mystery. \nks5u",

And some European countries and America have made it a law that children, teenagers and drivers must wear resinous glasses. Now, about 10 million children in China have different eyesight problems and they need timely treatment.\nBut still, too many parents are buying the traditional glass glasses for their children.

        "context": "Is It OK to Snap   Your Food?\nHave you ever taken a snap of a luxurious cake or photographed a juicy steak when you eat in restaurants? You may want to share what you eat with your friends or just post part of your daily life onto the Internet. However, such action may be very annoying  to other diners, or even to chefs and restaurant owners. Currently, more and more people begin to consider \" foodstagramming\" as very silly and a bad manner.\nIn many restaurants, diners complain of being blinded by flasher , snapped without their permission and disturbed by people climbing on to chairs for a better angle. Even chefs and restaurant owners are annoyed at food photography. A Michelin-starred  chef said, \"It's hard to build a memorable evening when flashes are flying every six minutes.\"\nAt the start of 2013, the debate on whether it is OK to take photographs of your food in restaurants seemed to swing   towards a definite \"no.\" According to several chefs in New York City, some restaurants there have started banning customers from taking photos of their food. Policies around the ban of food photography vary from restaurant to restaurant, ranging from restrictions on using a flash to outright  bans. If other restaurants follow such policies, it may signal the death of \" foodstagramming\".\nNevertheless, instead of banning food photography, some restaurants are offering food photography courses. In Spain, the restaurant group Grupo Gourmet has started running a \" Fotografia para foodies\" course to instruct its customers to better take food pictures. The course teaches customers to take photos in a proper way without disturbing other dinners, such as never use a flash.",

Wilson, a biologist at Harvard, called the depletion   of rain forest areas \"the greatest extinction since the end of the age of dinosaurs\".\nUnlike some environmental issues, rain forest depletion has fortunately received significant public and media attention. Despite the opposition to the cutting down of rain forests, the problem continues. Every year, Brazil chops down an area of forest the size of the state of Nebraska. In addition to the Amazon's rain forests, many other forests are being cut down as well. In Indonesia, Zaire, Papua-new Geinea, Malaysia, Burma, the Philippines, Peru, Colombia, Bolivia, and Venezuela, rain forests that were once great have been lost.\nAccording to some estimates, 50 million acres of rain forests are cut down every year. The United Nations says the figure is closer to 17 million acres. The World Wildlife Fund says every minute, 25 to 50 acres are cut or burned to the ground.\nThe world's growing population has been a primary reason of rain forest destruction. More people need land to live on and wood products to consume. Limiting population growth may be the first in a series of steps that would limit the destruction of the rain forests.",

The latest research makes it known that the reason could be that men's hearts go into rapid decline  when they reach middle age.\nThe largest study of the effects of ageing on the heart has found that women's _ may be linked to the fact that their hearts do not lose their pumping power with age.\n\"We have found that the power of the male heart falls by 20-25 percent between 18 and 70 years of age,\" said the head of the study, David Goldspink of Liverpool John Moores University in the UK.\n\"Within the heart there are millions of cells that enable it to beat. Between the age of 20 and 70, one-third of those cells die and are not replaced in men,\" said Goldspink. \"This is part of the ageing process.\"\nWhat surprises scientists is that the female heart sees very little loss of these cells. A healthy 70-year-old woman's heart could perform almost as well as a 20-year-old one's. \"This gender( ) difference might just explain why women live longer than men,\" said Goldspink. They studied more than 250 healthy men and women between the ages of 18 and 80, focusing on healthy persons to remove the confusing influence of disease. \"The team has yet to find why ageing takes a greater loss on the male heart,\" said Goldspink.\nThe good news is that men can improve the health of their heart with regular exercise. Goldspink stressed that women also need regular exercise to prevent their leg muscles becoming smaller and weaker as they age.",

The show takes the ever-common talk show titles of love, sex, cheating, and hate, to a different level. Clearly, the Jerry Springer show is about the dark side of society, yet people are willing to eat up the troubles of other people's lives.\nLike Jerry Springer, Oprah Winfrey takes the TV talk show to its top. But Oprah goes in the opposite direction. The show is mainly about the improvement of society and different quality of life. Contents are from teaching your children lessons, managing your work week, to getting to know your neighbors.\nCompared to Oprah, the Jerry Springer show looks like poisonous waste being poured into society. Jerry ends every show with a \"final word\". He makes a small speech about the entire idea of the show. Hopefully, this is the part where most people will learn something very valuable.\nClean as it is, the Oprah show is not for everyone. The show's main audience are middle-class Americans. Most of the people have the time, money and ability to deal with life's tough problems. Jerry Springer, on the other hand, has more of a connection with the young adults of society.",

        "context": "A new survey finds that more than eighty percent of Internet users in the United States search for health information online. The survey found that searching online is one of the leading ways that people look for a second opinion though doctors are still the main source of health information.\nForty-four percent of people are actually looking for doctors or other providers when they search for health information online. Another finding of the survey: Two-thirds of Internet users look online for information about a specific disease or medical condition.\nThe Internet has also become an important source of emotional support for people with health problems. Susannah Fox says one in five Internet users has gone online to find other people who have the same condition. It was more popular among people with more serious health issues--one in four people living with chronic diseases  . And it was basically _ with people living with rare disease. They are so eager to find other people online who share their health concerns.\nA disease is considered rare if it affects fewer than two hundred thousand people worldwide. The rise of social networking has made it easier for people with rare diseases to connect with each other and feel less alone. Social networking is also changing the way some doctors and patients communicate with each other. Dr. Jeff Livingston operates a medical center for women in Irving, Texas. His office uses password-protected software to share information with patients.\n\"We provide the patient full access to their medical care. Anything I can see, the patient can see. All of their notes, all of their doctor visits are right there. All of their lab work is right there.\" Dr. Livingston says the software has increased efficiency, reduced costs and improved relations with patients.",

We were living in College Station, Texas and my wife and I were on our way home from Houston, Texas one Saturday morning. We decided to stop at a local restaurant to get something to eat since we had enough time. When we finished, we got back into our car and before I started it, we noticed a homeless man standing in front of the building. His clothes were worn and it looked as though he didn't have any money. It was cold and I was sure he wanted something warm to drink; however, it was not this that I remember, because that is not what \"moved\" me. A dog was also walking up to the front of the building. Being a dog owner, I knew that the dog was a mother, and that she had just had some pups  . She was hungry and weak and I felt bad for her. I knew if she didn't eat soon, she and her pups would not live. People walking by didn't even notice her. She was not as pretty and clean as most dogs, but she still deserved   better. We still did not do anything, but someone else did. The homeless man, who I thought could not afford anything to eat, went into the store and bought dog food with all the money he had.",

But Lee realized something was wrong when Alex came home one day, crying, with \"zeroes\" on his Chinese spelling test. Lee decided to investigate. According to Lee, the teacher would frequently describe Alex's Chinese writing as 'ghost writings' and made him a laughing stock in class instead of helping him out.\nLee, 46, spent the next 12 months teaching Alex and still helps him when necessary. She not only taught him the formation of the Chinese words but also their origin so that he could understand better, often taking more than an hour to read a simple paragraph. Visits to the library and surfing the Internet kept her up to speed on teaching materials. Alex's grades improved and by the end of Year One, he had become one of the top students in Chinese in his class.\nAlex is keeping an A - plus average in all subjects, and his mother's involvement is a big reason behind it. Alex, now 11, recently wrote a book recording his struggles with Chinese, which an international education center has published to inspire its students. He sometimes writes for local student magazines as well. \nLee has always had input into the education of Alex. She reads to him \"all the time.\" As a result, he is an eager reader who regularly visit the library.\nTo Lee, one of the most valuable things she does is to take turns with her husband to drive Alex to school. \"We'd talk along the way. Talking enables me to have a better understanding of my child and reminds me of changes every now and then so that I know when to get involved, she says.\"",

        "context": "Two people have died after two separate university shootings in Texas and Arizona, just hours apart. One person was killed and three injured in the first shooting at Northern Arizona University early on Friday. Later that morning a shooting at a student complex near Texas Southern University left one person dead.\nIn Arizona, police named the gunman there as Steven Jones, an 18-year-old first year student at Northern Arizona University.Mr. Jones told police he was approached by a group of men and attacked. He fled, produced a gun from his pocket and opened fire when the men caught up with him, Arizona police said. Witnesses told police that the victims were unarmed.\nThe second shooting in Texas happened later on Friday morning at the University Courtyard Apartments on the edge of the Houston campus. One student was killed, a freshman at the school, the university confirmed, and another person was wounded. Two people have been arrested as suspects and a third is still at large, said Houston police spokeswoman Jodi Silva.\nThe attacks came as President Barack Obama visited families of victims of a college shooting in Oregon. On arriving in Oregon, he was jeered  by gun rights activists who oppose calls he made for tougher gun laws after nine people were killed at Umpqua Community College, Roseburg, last week.\nAfter a private meeting with families, Mr Obama said he had \"strong feelings\" about gun control, adding: \"We are going to have to come together as a country to see how we can prevent these issues from taking place.\"\nOn the edge of this little American town, a few hundred protestors gathered to tell their president he was not welcome. Many were openly carrying handguns to _ their message. The demonstrators blamed the shooting here last week on two things: a failure to treat mental health problems and the designation of Umpqua Community College as a gun-free zone. Many of those we spoke to said they had travelled to Roseburg from elsewhere in Oregon to make their voices hear. The hostility to the Democratic president here in Republican rural Oregon was not just political, it was personal.",

        "context": "Child labor -- the employment of children in industry, often against their will -- has been a problem for many years. Over a hundred years ago, Charles Dickens shocked many of his readers when he described the conditions under which young children worked in British factories. The conditions Dickens described continue almost unchanged today in many parts of the world. The only difference is that today employment of children is confined(limited)to small industries and family businesses, such as hotels, restaurants and particularly farms, rather than to large factories.\nGirls suffer more from child labor practices than boys. Many of them are forced to start work when they are only ten years old. Although the work they are given to do is often light, it is often harmful to the health. Recently, children as young as six years were found to be working in Asian factories, and the children were working from eight to fourteen hours a day in overcrowded and unhealthy working conditions. Sometimes a whole family group is employed, with the payment going to a parent or older relative. The children not only receive nothing or very little for their long hours of work, but also they are prevented from attending school. Therefore, when they become older they are unable to do any other kind of work.\nThe solution to the problem of child labor is clearly better laws to protect young children, greater supervision of industry and heavier fines for those who break the laws. Only in this way can young boys and girls be allowed to enjoy the most valuable time of their lives--childhood.",

This may be as simple as being aware of color1 and texture ,as well as taste, when we plan a meal. Above all,it is the ability to notice things that others might miss. \nA second part of creativity is an ability to see relationships among things. If we believe the expression,there is nothing new under the sun,the creativity is remaking or recombining the old in new ways. For example,we might do this by finding a more effective way to study or a better way to arrange our furniture,or we might make a new combination of camera lenses and filters to create an unusual photograph. \nA third part of creativity is the courage and drive to make use of our new ideas,to ask for them to achieve some new results.

Her name is Sandra Keierleber. I first met her at volleyball tryouts , but didn't notice anything special at first. As the week passed, however, she showed she had more heart than anyone. She stood out because she never gave up, no matter what.\nSandra isn't the tallest or the fastest --- in fact, this was her first time playing volleyball and it showed--- but that didn't stop her. She was always the first to arrive and the last to leave. By the end of tryouts she had found a place in everyone's heart. When the name list for new members was put up, we all waited nervously as she checked. When she stood at the door and smiled happily, all we could do was cheer.\nAfter Sandra made the team, she worked even harder to improve her game. When she asked for help, we gladly taught her. She also became our fan, attending almost every school game and even joining us in the city games. We all like her, because she never thinks about doing things the easy way, or loses that smile. Because of her great efforts, she makes herself a true hero--- and my hero, too.",

        "context": "The Streisand Effect\nWhen Barbra Streisand discovered in 2003 that a photograph of her California beach house was among 12,000 photos on the Internet as part of a collection by a photographer Kenneth Adelman, she did what any famous person would do: hit him with a $50 million lawsuit  . But in trying to hold back the images, she caused a different result. Her legal actions led to almost half a million people visiting the website, viewing and copying the photos within a month.\nEver since then, the effect of letting public know something you are trying to keep secret has been called the \"Streisand effect\". The problem for anyone trying to cover up information is that the Internet is the world's biggest and most useful copying machine. Put a document   on to a connected machine and it will spread. So when you want to be famous, you can't, but if you find yourself receiving too much attention and want to remove yourself, you cannot.  \nThere are many examples of the Streisand effect. Nine-year-old Martha Payne created a simple blog, posting the meals her school served. She took a photo of what was hardly a satisfying meal by anyone's standards. With the photo, she added a comment, \"Now Dad understands why I am hungry when I get home.\" The thing did not go too far, until the local authority   banned   little Martha from doing that again. Martha posted a final post called \"Goodbye\", explaining everything. Once the media found this out, things went from bad to worse for the authority. Now the blog has more than 9.5 million page views. Martha has even expanded her blog by including pictures of school meals taken by other kids from all over the world, like Germany and Japan.\nWe can find similar examples throughout history. Man has experienced the Streisand effect ever since the birth of mass communication. Why does it exist? Every time you are told not to see what's in the secret shiny box wrapped in gift paper, you're going to do everything in your power to do exactly that! Just realizing that knowing something about someone is harmful to their status, we will want to know that piece of information. This is exactly the human nature. This is what lawyers and authorities should be familiar with. Unfortunately, a few of them fail to understand it.",

The old woman held Jack's hand strongly, and said, \"I mean it!\" Jack felt the hairs on his neck stand up. As soon as the lady let go of his hand, he started to run. This time, he ran so fast that he didn't have time to think where he was going.\nWhen he stopped, he realized he was in the middle of the park. He remembered what the old woman had said, but it was too late. He thought, \"It would be okay if I run really fast.\" Suddenly, he heard someone scream . Jack was too frightened to wonder who it was. He breathed as deep as possible. The screaming continued. He heard some fast footsteps approaching, so he turned around. It was the old lady! She walked toward him, and shouted \"I told you not to come here!\"\nFrightened to death, Jack screamed sharply and ran home like an arrow. He thought he heard not only the old lady, but also some other people shouting at him, and it made him more terrified. As soon as Jack saw his mother, Jack said, \"Mom!

        "context": "Due to climate change, Arctic ice is breaking up earlier in the spring, and its area is decreasing. This is creating problems for polar bears that make their homes off northern Alaska and in Hudson Bay.\nPolar bears off Alaska normally hunt and raise their young on ice sheets that float on the ocean. But as the ice has melted, the polar bears have been forced to spend more time on land. There, they have begun to frequent beaches, feeding on the remains of whales caught by native hunters. For polar bears, this food is less nutritious than seals that they normally catch on ice sheets. The shrinking  ice has also forced more polar bears into the ocean. In the past, they only had to swim short distances between ice sheets. But as the ice has shrunk, polar bears have been forced to swim longer and longer distances in the open ocean. This poses a severe danger during rough weather, and an increasing number of drowned polar bears have been observed.\nIn Hudson Bay, the ice breaks up three weeks earlier in the spring now than it did 20 years ago. Polar bears on Hudson Bay fast  during the summer, waiting for ice to form in the fall to hunt. Every year, the summer gets longer, and the bears get skinnier. Over the past 25 years, the average weight of the female bears has dropped 68 kg. This loss affects their ability to reproduce, and already the number of births has dropped 15 percent. Unless the bears can learn to survive these climate changes, these giants of the ice may one day disappear.",

I could have collapsed in tears right there at the table.\nWhen we picked up the check, the waitress said, \"Your meal was already paid for.\" My friend and I didn't have a clue how it happened.

The waitress said, \"Yes, the gentleman who was in here a while ago paid for you.\"\nJust last year, I was running a half-marathon. With just 0.1 miles to go, I was out of gas. Runners call it \"hitting the wall\"; I thought I couldn't move another muscle. Out of nowhere, a teenager jogged up next to me and said, \"What's your name sweetie? Jennifer? Okay, Jennifer, let's go! Come on! It's just around the corner! You can do it!\". And he ran with me until I picked up my pace. I found him at the finish line to thank him for the encouragement only to learn he wasn't even supposed to be in the race that day.

If one is thinking in terms of science fiction and the space age, it is at least possible to assume that man will have solved such trivial and earthly problems as housing. Writers of science fiction, from H.G. Wells onwards, have had little to say on the subject. They have conveyed the suggestion that men will live in great comfort, with every imaginable apparatus  to make life smooth, healthy and easy, if not happy. But they have not said what his house will be made of. Perhaps some new building material, as yet unimagined, will have been discovered or invented at least. One may be certain that bricks and mortar(,) will long have gone out of fashion.\nBut the problems of the next generation or two can more readily be imagined. Scientists have already pointed out that unless something is done either to restrict the world's rapid growth in population or to discover and develop new sources of food (or both), millions of people will be dying of starvation or at the best suffering from underfeeding before this century is out. But nobody has yet worked out any plan for housing these growing populations. Admittedly the worst situations will occur in the hottest parts of the world, where housing can be light structure or in backward areas where standards are traditionally low. But even the minimum shelter requires materials of some kind and in the teeming, bulging towns the low-standard \"housing\" of flattened petrol cans and dirty canvas is far more wasteful of ground space than can be tolerated.\nSince the war, Hong Kong has suffered the kind of crisis which is likely to arise in many other places during the next generation. Literally millions of refugees arrived to swell the already growing population and emergency steps had to be taken rapidly to prevent squalor and disease and the spread crime. The city is tackling the situation energetically and enormous blocks of tenements are rising at an astonishing aped. But Hong Kong is only one small part of what will certainly become a vast problem and not merely a housing problem, because when population grows at this rate there are accompanying problems of education, transport, hospital services, drainage, water supply and so on. Not every area may give the same resources as Hong Kong to draw upon and the search for quicker and cheaper methods of construction must never stop.",
