      "2024-03-30 16:08:25,626 - INFO - Paragraph 1: context The following article details the history of Monday Night Football , the weekly broadcast of National Football League games on U.S. television . During the early 1960s , NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle envisioned the possibility of playing at least one game weekly during prime time that could be viewed by a greater television audience ( while the NFL had scheduled Saturday night games on the DuMont Television Network in 1953 and 1954 , poor ratings and the dissolution of DuMont led to those games being eliminated by the time CBS took over the rights in 1956 ) . An early bid by the league in 1964 to play on Friday nights was soundly defeated , with critics charging that such telecasts would damage the attendance at high school football games . Undaunted , Rozelle decided to experiment with the concept of playing on Monday night , scheduling the Green Bay Packers and Detroit Lions for a game on September 28 , 1964 . While the game was not televised , it drew a sellout crowd of 59,203 spectators to Tiger Stadium , the largest crowd ever to watch a professional football game in Detroit up to that point . Two years later , Rozelle would build on this success as the NFL began a four - year experiment of playing on Monday night , scheduling one game in prime time on CBS during the 1966 and 1967 seasons , and two contests during each of the next two years . NBC followed suit in 1968 and 1969 with games involving American Football League teams . \n",

After the series ' third season , The WB merged with UPN to form The CW , and since September 27 , 2006 , the network has been the official broadcaster of the series in the United States . The show is set in the fictional town of Tree Hill in North Carolina and originally follows the lives of two half - brothers , Lucas Scott ( Chad Michael Murray ) and Nathan Scott ( James Lafferty ) , who compete for positions on their school 's basketball team , and the drama that ensues from the brothers ' romances . Most of the filming took place in and around Wilmington , North Carolina . Many of the scenes were shot near the battleship USS North Carolina and on the University of North Carolina Wilmington campus . The first four seasons of the show focus on the main characters ' lives through their high school years . With the beginning of the fifth season , Schwahn advanced the timeline by four years to show their lives after college , and he made it jump a further fourteen months from the end of the sixth to the start of the seventh season . The opening credits were originally accompanied by the song `` I Do n't Want to Be '' by Gavin DeGraw . The theme was removed from the opening in the fifth season ; Schwahn said that this was to lower production costs , to add more time for the storyline , and because he felt that the song was more representative of the core characters ' adolescent past than their present maturity . The credits then consisted only of the title written on a black background . The theme was restored for season 8 , in response to audience demand , and was sung by different artists each week . The series premiered to 2.5 million viewers and rose to 3.3 million in its second week , becoming one of only three shows to rise in their second episode during the 2003 -- 2004 television season . Season one went on to average 3.5 million viewers , and the second season was the highest rated in the series , averaging 4.3 million viewers weekly and a 1.9 Adults 18 -- 49 rating .

The Broncos finished the 2014 season with a 12 -- 4 record and the AFC 's No. 2 seed . However , the Broncos were defeated by the Indianapolis Colts in the Divisional round of the 2014 playoffs , marking the third time in four seasons that the Broncos lost in the Divisional round of the playoffs . Quarterback Peyton Manning had been playing with strained quadriceps for the final month of the 2014 season . On January 12 , 2015 , one day after the aforementioned Divisional playoff loss to the Colts , the Broncos and head coach John Fox mutually agreed to part ways . Fox left the Broncos with a . 719 winning percentage in his four seasons as the Broncos ' head coach -- the highest in franchise history . One week later , the Broncos hired Gary Kubiak as the team 's 15th head coach . Kubiak served as a backup quarterback to executive vice president / general manager John Elway from 1983 -- 1991 , as well as the Broncos ' offensive coordinator from 1995 -- 2005 .

On March 7 , 2016 , quarterback Peyton Manning retired after 18 NFL seasons during a press conference at the team 's Dove Valley headquarters .

The Browns ' first selection as an NFL team was Ken Carpenter , a wide receiver from Oregon State . The team 's most recent first round selections were Baker Mayfield , quarterback at Oklahoma and Denzel Ward , cornerback at Ohio State . Every year during April , each NFL franchise seeks to add new players to its roster through a collegiate draft known as `` the NFL Annual Player Selection Meeting '' , which is more commonly known as the NFL Draft . Teams are ranked in inverse order based on the previous season 's record , with the worst record picking first , and the second worst picking second and so on . The two exceptions to this order are made for teams that appeared in the previous Super Bowl ; the Super Bowl champion always picks 32nd , and the Super Bowl loser always picks 31st . Teams have the option of trading away their picks to other teams for different picks , players , cash , or a combination thereof . Thus , it is not uncommon for a team 's actual draft pick to differ from their assigned draft pick , or for a team to have extra or no draft picks in any round due to these trades .

Historian Richard B. Morris in 1973 identified the following seven figures as the key Founding Fathers : John Adams , Benjamin Franklin , Alexander Hamilton , John Jay , Thomas Jefferson , James Madison , and George Washington . Adams , Jefferson , and Franklin were members of the Committee of Five that drafted the Declaration of Independence . Hamilton , Madison , and Jay were authors of The Federalist Papers , advocating ratification of the Constitution . The constitutions drafted by Jay and Adams for their respective states of New York ( 1777 ) and Massachusetts ( 1780 ) were heavily relied upon when creating language for the US Constitution Jay , Adams and Franklin negotiated the Treaty of Paris ( 1783 ) that would end the American Revolutionary War . Washington was Commander - in - Chief of the Continental Army and was President of the Constitutional Convention . Washington , Jay and Franklin are considered the Founding Fathers of U.S. Intelligence by the CIA . All held additional important roles in the early government of the United States , with Washington , Adams , Jefferson , and Madison serving as President . Jay was the nation 's first Chief Justice . Four of these seven - Washington , Jay , Hamilton and Madison - were not signers of the Declaration of Independence . The term Founding Fathers is sometimes used to refer to the Signers of the embossed version of the Declaration of Independence in 1776 . It is not to be confused with the term Framers ; the Framers are defined by the National Archives as those 55 individuals who were appointed to be delegates to the 1787 Constitutional Convention and took part in drafting the proposed Constitution of the United States . Of the 55 Framers , only 39 were signers of the Constitution . Two further groupings of Founding Fathers include : 1 ) those who signed the Continental Association , a trade ban and one of the colonists ' first collective volleys protesting British control and the Intolerable Acts in 1774 or 2 ) those who signed the Articles of Confederation , the first U.S. constitutional document .

      "2024-02-15 20:54:18,968 - INFO - Paragraph 1: context A period of increasing trouble and decline began with the reign of Commodus . Commodus ' assassination in 192 triggered the Year of the Five Emperors , of which Septimius Severus emerged victorious . The assassination of Alexander Severus in 235 led to the Crisis of the Third Century in which 26 men were declared emperor by the Roman Senate over a fifty - year time span . It was not until the reign of Diocletian that the empire was fully stabilized with the introduction of the Tetrarchy , which saw four emperors rule the empire at once . This arrangement was ultimately unsuccessful , leading to a civil war that was finally ended by Constantine the Great , who defeated his rivals and became the sole ruler of the empire in 324 . Constantine subsequently established a second capital city in Byzantium , which he renamed Constantinople . It remained the capital of the east until its demise . Constantine also adopted Christianity which later became the official state religion of the empire . Following the death of Theodosius I in 395 , the empire was permanently divided between the West and the East . The dominion of the Western Roman Empire was gradually eroded by abuses of power , civil wars , barbarian migrations and invasions , military reforms and economic depression . The Sack of Rome in 410 by the Visigoths and again in 455 by the Vandals accelerated the Western Empire 's decay , while the deposition of the emperor , Romulus Augustulus , in 476 by Odoacer , is generally accepted to mark the end of the empire in the west . However , Augustulus was never recognized by his Eastern colleague , and separate rule in the Western part of the empire only ceased to exist upon the death of Julius Nepos , in 480 . The Eastern Roman Empire ( in modern historiography called the Byzantine Empire ) endured for another millennium as one of the leading powers in the world alongside its arch - rival the Sassanid Empire , which had inherited a centuries - old Roman - Persian conflict from its predecessor the Parthians . The Byzantine Empire eventually fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453 . The Roman Empire was among the most powerful economic , cultural , political and military forces in the world of its time . It was one of the largest empires in world history . At its height under Trajan , it covered 5 million square kilometres . It held sway over an estimated 70 million people , at that time 21 % of the world 's entire population . The longevity and vast extent of the empire ensured the lasting influence of Latin and Greek language , culture , religion , inventions , architecture , philosophy , law and forms of government on the empire 's descendants . Throughout the European medieval period , attempts were even made to establish successors to the Roman Empire , including the Empire of Romania , a Crusader state ; and the Holy Roman Empire . By means of European colonialism following the Renaissance , and their descendant states , Greco - Roman and Judaeo - Christian culture was exported on a worldwide scale , playing a crucial role in the development of the modern world . Rome had begun expanding shortly after the founding of the republic in the 6th century BC , though it did not expand outside the Italian Peninsula until the 3rd century BC . Then , it was an `` empire '' long before it had an emperor . The Roman Republic was not a nation - state in the modern sense , but a network of towns left to rule themselves ( though with varying degrees of independence from the Roman Senate ) and provinces administered by military commanders . It was ruled , not by emperors , but by annually elected magistrates ( Roman Consuls above all ) in conjunction with the senate . For various reasons , the 1st century BC was a time of political and military upheaval , which ultimately led to rule by emperors . The consuls ' military power rested in the Roman legal concept of imperium , which literally means `` command '' ( though typically in a military sense ) . Occasionally , successful consuls were given the honorary title imperator ( commander ) , and this is the origin of the word emperor ( and empire ) since this title ( among others ) was always bestowed to the early emperors upon their accession .

      "2024-02-15 20:55:10,768 - INFO - Paragraph 1: context The French Revolution ( French : Révolution française ( ʁevɔlysjɔ̃ fʁɑ̃sɛːz ) ) was a period of far - reaching social and political upheaval in France that lasted from 1789 until 1799 , and was partially carried forward by Napoleon during the later expansion of the French Empire . The Revolution overthrew the monarchy , established a republic , experienced violent periods of political turmoil , and finally culminated in a dictatorship under Napoleon that rapidly brought many of its principles to Western Europe and beyond . Inspired by liberal and radical ideas , the Revolution profoundly altered the course of modern history , triggering the global decline of absolute monarchies while replacing them with republics and liberal democracies . Through the Revolutionary Wars , it unleashed a wave of global conflicts that extended from the Caribbean to the Middle East . Historians widely regard the Revolution as one of the most important events in human history . The causes of the French Revolution are complex and are still debated among historians . Following the Seven Years ' War and the American Revolutionary War , the French government was deeply in debt and attempted to restore its financial status through unpopular taxation schemes , which were heavily regressive . Years of bad harvests leading up to the Revolution also inflamed popular resentment of the privileges enjoyed by the clergy and the aristocracy . Demands for change were formulated in terms of Enlightenment ideals and contributed to the convocation of the Estates - General in May 1789 . The first year of the Revolution saw members of the Third Estate taking control , the assault on the Bastille in July , the passage of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen in August , and a women 's march on Versailles that forced the royal court back to Paris in October . A central event of the first stage , in August 1789 , was the abolition of feudalism and the old rules and privileges left over from the Ancien Régime . The next few years featured political struggles between various liberal assemblies and right - wing supporters of the monarchy intent on thwarting major reforms . The Republic was proclaimed in September 1792 after the French victory at Valmy . In a momentous event that led to international condemnation , Louis XVI was executed in January 1793 .

Traditionally , the two numerical digits signified the engine 's displacement size , however , recent models have deviated from such correlation . AMG was founded as a racing engine forge in 1967 under the name AMG Motorenbau und Entwicklungsgesellschaft mbH ( AMG Engine Production and Development , Ltd . ) , by former Mercedes - Benz engineers Hans Werner Aufrecht and Erhard Melcher in Burgstall an der Murr , near Stuttgart . The letters `` AMG '' stand for Aufrecht , Melcher and Großaspach ( Aufrecht 's birth town ) . In 1976 most of AMG moved to Affalterbach , with the racing - engine development remaining at the old location in Burgstall . At this time Erhard Melcher ceased to be a partner , but continued to be an employee at the Burgstall location . In 1993 , with AMG having become a high - profile purveyor of modified Mercedes - Benz cars , Daimler - Benz AG and AMG signed a contract of cooperation , allowing AMG to leverage Daimler - Benz 's extensive dealer network and leading to commonly developed vehicles ( the first one being the Mercedes - Benz C36 AMG , in 1993 ) .

Racing engine development was divested and continues to exist in Burgstall under the name HWA ( Aufrecht 's initials ) .

They wanted it to look like an old hand - tinted picture , with the intensity of colors dictated by the scene and natural skin tones that were all shades of the rainbow . '' Initially the crew tried to perform the color correction using a physical process , however after several tries with various chemical processes proved unsatisfactory , it became necessary to perform the process digitally . This was the fifth film collaboration between the Coen Brothers and Deakins , and it was slated to be shot in Mississippi at a time of year when the foliage , grass , trees , and bushes would be a lush green . It was filmed near locations in Canton , Mississippi and Florence , South Carolina in the summer of 1999 . After shooting tests , including film bipack and bleach bypass techniques , Deakins suggested digital mastering be used . Deakins subsequently spent 11 weeks fine - tuning the look , mainly targeting the greens , making them a burnt yellow and desaturating the overall image in the digital files . This made it the first feature film to be entirely color corrected by digital means , narrowly beating Nick Park 's Chicken Run .

Such `` suburban agriculture '' led to more than 70 % of non-staple food in Beijing , mainly consisting of vegetables and milk , to be produced by the city itself in the 1960s and 1970s . Recently , with relative food security in China , periurban agriculture has led to improvements in the quality of the food available , as opposed to quantity . One of the more recent experiments in urban agriculture is the Modern Agricultural Science Demonstration Park in Xiaotangshan . About 75 % of China 's cultivated area is used for food crops . Rice is China 's most important crop , raised on about 25 % of the cultivated area . The majority of rice is grown south of the Huai River , in the Zhu Jiang delta , and in the Yunnan , Guizhou , and Sichuan provinces . Wheat is the second most - prevalent grain crop , grown in most parts of the country but especially on the North China Plain , the Wei and Fen River valleys on the Loess plateau , and in Jiangsu , Hubei , and Sichuan provinces .

The screenplay , adapted by producer Carl Foreman , made significant changes from the novel The Guns of Navarone by Alistair MacLean . The film was directed by J. Lee Thompson . Thompson was brought in after original director Alexander Mackendrick was fired by Carl Foreman a week before shooting started due to `` creative differences '' . The Greek island of Rhodes provided locations and Quinn was so taken with the area that he bought land there in an area still called Anthony Quinn Bay . Some further scenes were shot on the islands of Gozo , near Malta , and Tino , in the Ligurian Sea . One of the warships in the film , the USS Slater , then a training ship in the Hellenic Navy known as Aetos ( D - 01 ) , is preserved as a museum ship in Albany , New York . As described by director Thompson in the DVD commentary track , David Niven became severely ill after shooting in the pool of water underneath the cave elevator and almost died , remaining in hospital for some weeks as other portions of the cave sequence were completed by the crew . However , since key scenes with Niven remained incomplete at that time , and it was doubtful whether he would be able to return to finish the film , the entire production was in jeopardy . Reshooting key scenes throughout the film with some other actor -- and even abandoning the whole project to collect the insurance -- was contemplated . Fortunately , Niven was able to complete his scenes some weeks later . Q: where was the film guns of navarone filmedA: Rhodes\n"

The film was released on 2 September 2010 . Critical response to the film was mixed and it failed to find an overseas audience . Filming began in the Hunter Region of New South Wales , Australia on 28 September 2009 with early shooting in Dungog . Raymond Terrace was chosen as a major location for producing the film as it is `` a great country town '' . Historic King Street , the former main street of the town , was transformed from a normally quiet location into Main Street , Wirrawee . The street began its transformation in September 2009 , with set areas including the `` Wirrawee Cinema '' and the Lee family 's Thai restaurant . Filming began in King Street on 21 October 2009 and continued until 27 October 2009 . Filming in other locations in the town ended on 6 November 2009 . Other filming locations included Maitland , the Blue Mountains and the Luskintyre bridge . The Fox Studios site in Sydney was also used . The explosions of the house and bridge were filmed , scaled - down , at Terrey Hills in northern Sydney . Tomorrow , When the War Began received mixed reviews . Review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes reports that 64 % of critics have given the film a positive review based on 54 reviews , with an average score of 5.6 / 10 . The site 's consensus is that `` While the script is n't amazing and the story 's race issues linger , this adaptation of John Marsden 's book is an exciting , action - heavy adventure that should please fans of the series . '' Marc Fennell of Triple J wrote that Tomorrow , When the War Began has `` patchy acting , fantastic action and some great slivers of humour in a movie that only gives off the faintest whiff of a xenophobic nation terrified of being invaded . '' Margaret Pomeranz of At the Movies wrote that `` Stuart Beattie handles the action well ; I think he 's less adept at handling the development of character , but I 'm sure the numerous fans of the book will be satisfied with the movie . '' A review by the Australian Special Broadcasting Service was less generous , pointing out parallels to the 1984 film Red Dawn , starring Charlie Sheen and Patrick Swayze .

The Northeast is one of the four regions defined by the United States Census Bureau for the collection and analysis of statistics . The Census Bureau - defined region has a total area of 181,324 sq mi ( 469,630 km ) with 162,257 sq mi ( 420,240 km ) of that being land mass . Although it lacks a unified cultural identity , the Northeastern region is the nation 's most economically developed , densely populated , and culturally diverse region . Of the nation 's four census regions , the Northeast is the second most urban , with 85 percent of its population residing in urban areas , led by the West with 90 percent . The Census Bureau has defined the Northeast region as comprising nine states : from northeast to southwest , they are New York , New Jersey , Vermont , Massachusetts , Rhode Island , Maine , Connecticut , New Hampshire , and Pennsylvania . The region is subdivided into New England ( the six states east of New York ) and the Mid-Atlantic states ( New York , New Jersey , and Pennsylvania ) . This definition has been essentially unchanged since 1880 and is widely used as a standard for data tabulation . The Census Bureau has acknowledged the limitations of this definition and the potential merits of a proposal created after the 1950 census that would include changing regional boundaries to include Delaware , Maryland , and Washington , D.C. with the Mid-Atlantic states , but ultimately decided that `` the new system did not win enough overall acceptance among data users to warrant adoption as an official new set of general - purpose State groupings .

Although other educational goals , including traditional literacy , computer literacy , library skills , and critical thinking skills , are related to information literacy and important foundations for its development , information literacy itself is emerging as a distinct skill set and a necessary key to one 's social and economic well - being in an increasingly complex information society . According to McTavish ( 2009 ) , in order to increase and maximize people 's contributions to a healthy , democratic and pluralistic society and maintain a prosperous and sustainable economy , governments and industries around the world are challenging education systems to focus people 's attention on literacy . In Canada , because of a great focus on a supposed literacy crisis , it has caused some alarm in some educational sectors . Brink ( 2006 ) researched government organization , such as Human Resources and Skill Development Canada , claims that almost half of working - age Canadians do not have the literacy skills they need to meet the ever - increasing demands of modern life . The phrase information literacy first appeared in print in a 1974 report written on behalf of the National Commission on Libraries and Information Science by Paul G. Zurkowski , who was at the time president of the Information Industry Association . Zurkowski used the phrase to describe the `` techniques and skills '' learned by the information literate `` for utilizing the wide range of information tools as well as primary sources in molding information solutions to their problems '' and drew a relatively firm line between the `` literates '' and `` information illiterates '' . The Presidential Committee on Information Literacy released a report on January 10 , 1989 , outlining the importance of information literacy , opportunities to develop information literacy , and an Information Age School . The report 's final name is the Presidential Committee on Information Literacy : Final Report . Q: who started using the term information literacy and when was it coinedA: Zurkowski, 1974\n"

The United States did not sign the Geneva Accords , which stated that the United States `` shall continue to seek to achieve unity through free elections supervised by the United Nations to insure that they are conducted fairly '' . In July 1955 , the prime minister of the Republic of Vietnam , Ngô Đình Diệm , announced that the Republic of Vietnam would not participate in elections to unify the country . He said that South Vietnam had not signed the Geneva Accords and was not bound by it . After the failure to reunify Vietnam by elections , the Democratic Republic of Vietnam attempted to unify the country by force in the Vietnam War ( 1955 -- 75 ) . North Vietnam and the Việt Cộng insurgents supported by their communist allies , including the Soviet Union and China , fought against the military of South Vietnam , the United States and other anti-communist military forces , including South Korea , Australia , Thailand , and smaller players . North Vietnam also supported indigenous communist rebels in Cambodia and Laos against their respective U.S. - backed governments . The war ended when North Vietnamese forces and the Việt Cộng defeated the Republic of Vietnam and in 1976 united the two parts of the country into the Socialist Republic of Vietnam . The expanded Democratic Republic retained North Vietnam 's political culture under Soviet influence and continued its existing memberships in international organisations such as Comecon . After about 300 years of partition by feudal dynasties , Vietnam was again under one single authority in 1802 when Gia Long founded the Nguyễn dynasty , but the country became a French protectorate after 1883 and under Japanese occupation after 1940 during World War II . Soon after Japan surrendered on September 2 , 1945 , the Việt Minh in the August Revolution entered Hanoi , and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam was proclaimed on September 2 , 1945 : a government for the entire country , replacing the Nguyễn dynasty . Hồ Chí Minh became leader of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam .

Because BSA is a small , stable , moderately non-reactive protein , it is often used as a blocker in immunohistochemistry . During immunohistochemistry , which is the process that uses antibodies to identify antigens in cells , tissue sections are often incubated with BSA blockers to bind nonspecific binding sites . This binding of BSA to nonspecific binding sites increases the chance that the antibodies will bind only to the antigens of interest . The BSA blocker improves sensitivity by decreasing background noise as the sites are covered with the moderately non-reactive protein . During this process , minimization of nonspecific binding of antibodies is essential in order to acquire the highest signal to noise ratio . BSA is also used as a nutrient in cell and microbial culture . In restriction digests , BSA is used to stabilize some enzymes during the digestion of DNA and to prevent adhesion of the enzyme to reaction tubes , pipet tips , and other vessels . This protein does not affect other enzymes that do not need it for stabilization . BSA is also commonly used to determine the quantity of other proteins , by comparing an unknown quantity of protein to known amounts of BSA ( see Bradford protein assay ) . BSA is used because of its ability to increase signal in assays , its lack of effect in many biochemical reactions , and its low cost , since large quantities of it can be readily purified from bovine blood , a byproduct of the cattle industry . Q: why we use bsa as standard for protein estimationA: Stabilization\n"

Human services programs exist in countries all around the world . Human services has its roots in charitable activities of religious and civic organizations that date back to the Colonial period . However , the academic discipline of human services did not start until the 1960s . At that time , a group of college academics started the new human services movement and began to promote the adoption of a new ideology about human service delivery and professionalism among traditional helping disciplines . The movement 's major goal was to make service delivery more efficient , effective , and humane . The other goals dealt with the reeducation of traditional helping professionals ( interprofessional education ) , to have a greater appreciation of the individual as a whole person ( humanistic psychology ) and to be accountable to the communities they serve ( postmodernism ) . Furthermore , professionals would learn to take responsibility at all levels of government , use systems approaches to consider human problems , and be involved in progressive social change . Traditional academic programs such as education , nursing , social work , law and medicine were resistant to the new human services movement 's ideology because it appeared to challenge their professional status . Changing the traditional concept of professionalism involved rethinking consumer control and the distribution of power . The new movement also called on human service professionals to work for social change . It was proposed that the reduction of the monopolistic control of professionals could result in democratization of knowledge and would lead to professionals advocating on behalf of clients and communities against professional establishments . The movement also hoped that human service delivery systems would become integrated , comprehensive , and more accessible , which would make them more humane for service users .

      "2024-02-15 20:58:01,122 - INFO - Paragraph 1: context Maslow 's hierarchy of needs is often portrayed in the shape of a pyramid with the largest , most fundamental needs at the bottom and the need for self - actualization and self - transcendence at the top . The most fundamental and basic four layers of the pyramid contain what Maslow called `` deficiency needs '' or `` d - needs '' : esteem , friendship and love , security , and physical needs . If these `` deficiency needs '' are not met -- with the exception of the most fundamental ( physiological ) need -- there may not be a physical indication , but the individual will feel anxious and tense . Maslow 's theory suggests that the most basic level of needs must be met before the individual will strongly desire ( or focus motivation upon ) the secondary or higher level needs . Maslow also coined the term `` metamotivation '' to describe the motivation of people who go beyond the scope of the basic needs and strive for constant betterment . The human brain is a complex system and has parallel processes running at the same time , thus many different motivations from various levels of Maslow 's hierarchy can occur at the same time . Maslow spoke clearly about these levels and their satisfaction in terms such as `` relative '' , `` general '' , and `` primarily '' . Instead of stating that the individual focuses on a certain need at any given time , Maslow stated that a certain need `` dominates '' the human organism . Thus Maslow acknowledged the likelihood that the different levels of motivation could occur at any time in the human mind , but he focused on identifying the basic types of motivation and the order in which they would tend to be met .

The final master tape of side one of the album shows `` Sunday Morning '' only penciled in before `` I 'm Waiting for the Man '' .

In the Greek Septuagint , christos was used to translate the Hebrew מָשִׁיחַ ( Mašíaḥ , messiah ) , meaning `` ( one who is ) anointed . '' In other European languages , equivalent words to Christian are likewise derived from the Greek , such as Chrétien in French and Cristiano in Spanish . The first recorded use of the term ( or its cognates in other languages ) is in the New Testament , in Acts 11 : 26 , after Barnabas brought Saul ( Paul ) to Antioch where they taught the disciples for about a year , the text says : `` ( ... ) the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch . '' The second mention of the term follows in Acts 26 : 28 , where Herod Agrippa II replied to Paul the Apostle , `` Then Agrippa said unto Paul , Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian . '' The third and final New Testament reference to the term is in 1 Peter 4 : 16 , which exhorts believers : `` Yet if ( any man suffer ) as a Christian , let him not be ashamed ; but let him glorify God on this behalf . '' Kenneth Samuel Wuest holds that all three original New Testament verses ' usages reflect a derisive element in the term Christian to refer to followers of Christ who did not acknowledge the emperor of Rome . The city of Antioch , where someone gave them the name Christians , had a reputation for coming up with such nicknames . However Peter 's apparent endorsement of the term led to its being preferred over `` Nazarenes '' and the term Christianoi from 1 Peter becomes the standard term in the Early Church Fathers from Ignatius and Polycarp onwards .

Therefore, the answer listing a 'physician, nurse, respiratory therapist' as team members of the RRT is correct.\n"

      "2024-02-15 21:01:35,688 - INFO - Paragraph 1: context Mohenjo - daro was built in the 26th century BCE . It was one of the largest cities of the ancient Indus Valley Civilization , also known as the Harappan Civilization , which developed around 3,000 BCE from the prehistoric Indus culture . At its height , the Indus Civilization spanned much of what is now Pakistan and North India , extending westwards to the Iranian border , south to Gujarat in India and northwards to an outpost in Bactria , with major urban centers at Harappa , Mohenjo - daro , Lothal , Kalibangan , Dholavira and Rakhigarhi . Mohenjo - daro was the most advanced city of its time , with remarkably sophisticated civil engineering and urban planning . When the Indus civilization went into sudden decline around 1900 BCE , Mohenjo - daro was abandoned . The ruins of the city remained undocumented for around 3,700 years until R.D. Banerji , an officer of the Archaeological Survey of India , visited the site in 1919 -- 20 , identifying the Buddhist stupa ( 150 -- 500 CE ) known to be there and finding a flint scraper which convinced him of the site 's antiquity . This led to large - scale excavations of Mohenjo - daro led by Kashinath Narayan Dikshit in 1924 -- 25 , and John Marshall in 1925 -- 26 . In the 1930s , major excavations were conducted at the site under the leadership of Marshall , D.K. Dikshitar and Ernest Mackay . Further excavations were carried out in 1945 by Ahmad Hasan Dani and Mortimer Wheeler . The last major series of excavations were conducted in 1964 and 1965 by Dr. George F. Dales . After 1965 excavations were banned due to weathering damage to the exposed structures , and the only projects allowed at the site since have been salvage excavations , surface surveys , and conservation projects . However , in the 1980s , German and Italian survey groups led by Dr. Michael Jansen and Dr. Maurizio Tosi used less invasive archeological techniques , such as architectural documentation , surface surveys , and localized probing , to gather further information about Mohenjo - daro . A dry core drilling conducted in 2015 by Pakistan 's National Fund for Mohenjo - daro revealed that the site is larger than the unearthed area . Mohenjo - daro has a planned layout with rectilinear buildings arranged on a grid plan . Most were built of fired and mortared brick ; some incorporated sun - dried mud - brick and wooden superstructures . The covered area of Mohenjo - daro is estimated at 300 hectares . The Oxford Handbook of Cities in World History offers a `` weak '' estimate of a peak population of around 40,000 . Q: who excavated the site of mahenjodaro in sindA: Wheeler\n"

      "2024-02-15 21:01:42,918 - INFO - Paragraph 1: context Maple syrup is a syrup usually made from the xylem sap of sugar maple , red maple , or black maple trees , although it can also be made from other maple species . In cold climates , these trees store starch in their trunks and roots before winter ; the starch is then converted to sugar that rises in the sap in late winter and early spring . Maple trees are tapped by drilling holes into their trunks and collecting the exuded sap , which is processed by heating to evaporate much of the water , leaving the concentrated syrup . Maple syrup was first collected and used by the indigenous peoples of North America , and the practice was adopted by European settlers , who gradually refined production methods . Technological improvements in the 1970s further refined syrup processing . The Canadian province of Quebec is by far the largest producer , responsible for 70 percent of the world 's output ; Canadian exports of maple syrup in 2016 were C $ 487 million ( about US $ 360 million ) , with Quebec accounting for some 90 percent of this total .

      "2024-02-15 21:01:53,950 - INFO - Paragraph 1: context Three speculative thinkers , al - Kindi , al - Farabi , and Avicenna , combined Aristotelianism and Neoplatonism with other ideas introduced through Islam , and Avicennism was later established as a result . Other influential Abbasid philosophers include al - Jahiz , and Ibn al - Haytham ( Alhacen ) . As the power shifted from the Umayyads to the Abbasids , the architecture styles changed also . The Christian styles evolved into a style based more on the Sasanian Empire utilizing mud bricks and baked bricks with carved stucco . Another major development was the creation or vast enlargement of cities as they were turned into the capital of the empire . First , starting with the creation of Baghdad , starting in 762 , which was planned as a walled city with a mosque and palace in the center . The walls were to have four gates to exit the city . Al - Mansur , who was responsible for the creation of Baghdad , also planned the city of Raqqa , along the Euphrates . Finally , in 836 , al - Mu'tasim moved the capital to a new site that he created along the Tigris , called Samarra . This city saw 60 years of work , with race - courses and game preserves to add to the atmosphere . Due to the dry remote nature of the environment , some of the palaces built in this era were isolated havens . Al - Ukhaidir Fortress is a fine example of this type of building which has stables , living quarters , and a mosque , all surrounding inner courtyards . Other mosques of this era , such as the Mosque of Ibn Tulun , in Cairo , and the Great Mosque of Kairouan in Tunisia while ultimately built during the Umayyad dynasty , it was substantially renovated in the 9th century . This renovation was so extensive as to ostensibly be a rebuild , was in the furthest reaches of the Muslim world , in an area that the Aghlabids controlled ; however the styles utilized were mainly of the Abbasids . Mesopotamia only has one surviving mausoleum from this era , in Samarra . This octagonal dome is the final resting place of al - Muntasir . Other architectural innovations and styles were few , such as the four - centered arch , and a dome erected on squinches . Unfortunately , much was lost due to the ephemeral nature of the stucco and luster tiles . The Near East has , since Roman times , been recognized as a center of quality glassware and crystal . 9th century finds from Samarra show styles similar to Sassanian forms . The types of objects made were bottles , flasks , vases , and cups utilized for domestic use . Decorations on these domestic items include molded flutes , honeycomb patterns , and inscriptions . Other styles seen that may not have come from the Sassanians were stamped items . These were typically round stamps , such as medallions or disks with animals , birds , or Kufic inscriptions . Colored lead glass , typically blue or green , have been found in Nishapur , along with prismatic perfume bottles . Finally , cut glass may have been the high point of Abbasid glass - working , decorated with floral and animal designs . Q: what city was built as the new capital for the abbasidsA: Baghdad\n"

Different laws apply in different countries to the wearing of seat belts .

Seat belts are not required for bus occupants , reversing drivers , and those driving some slow moving vehicles . The laws for these differ depending on the state or territory with jurisdiction .

The central nervous system is so named because it integrates information it receives from , and coordinates and influences the activity of , all parts of the bodies of bilaterally symmetric animals -- that is , all multicellular animals except sponges and radially symmetric animals such as jellyfish -- and it contains the majority of the nervous system . Many consider the retina and the optic nerve ( cranial nerve II ) , as well as the olfactory nerves ( cranial nerve I ) and olfactory epithelium as parts of the CNS , synapsing directly on brain tissue without intermediate ganglia . As such , the olfactory epithelium is the only central nervous tissue in direct contact with the environment , which opens up for therapeutic treatments . The CNS is contained within the dorsal body cavity , with the brain housed in the cranial cavity and the spinal cord in the spinal canal . In vertebrates , the brain is protected by the skull , while the spinal cord is protected by the vertebrae . The brain and spinal cord are both enclosed in the meninges . In central nervous systems , the interneuronal space is filled with a large amount of supporting non-nervous cells called neuroglial cells . The central nervous system consists of the two major structures : the brain and spinal cord . The brain is encased in the skull , and protected by the cranium . The spinal cord is continuous with the brain and lies caudally to the brain , and is protected by the vertebrae .
