6065,Bloomingdale Firehouse,Worcester Cold Storage and Warehouse Co. fire,False,False,"The text provided states that Bloomingdale Firehouse is a historic former firehouse at 267 Plantation Street/676 Franklin Street in Worcester, Massachusetts. The building was constructed in 1895-96 and is a well-preserved example of Queen Anne and Colonial Revival styling. It served as a firehouse until 2008, and after it was replaced by a new station, it was converted into a private residence. Furthermore, it confirms that the Bloomingdale Firehouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Notably, while the Bloomingdale Firehouse was mentioned as having historical significance, it is not described as a 6-story building; no information about its number of stories is given.

The question, however, asks for a ""6-story building"" that was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. There seems to be a discrepancy as the story height is not mentioned in the description of the Bloomingdale Firehouse.

Based on the paragraphs provided, no direct association is drawn between the height of the Bloomingdale Firehouse and its listing in 1980. The text does mention the Worcester Cold Storage and Warehouse Co. fire occurring in a 6-story building, but this information is given in a different context, and this building is clearly indicated to have burned down in 1999, not listed in 1980.

Therefore, with the information available, the answer stating that the Bloomingdale Firehouse—a building with an unspecified number of stories—was the 6-story building listed in 1980 is incorrect because there is no text evidence supporting that this building is actually 6 stories high.
