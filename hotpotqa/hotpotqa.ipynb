Paragraph 3: Alien autopsy The alien autopsy is a 17-minute black and white film depicting a medical examination or autopsy. It was released in 1995 by London-based entrepreneur Ray Santilli. He presented it as an authentic autopsy on the body of an extraterrestrial being recovered from the 1947 crash of a \"flying disc\" near Roswell, New Mexico. The film footage was allegedly supplied to him by a retired military cameraman who wished to remain anonymous. Paragraph 4: Harum Scarum (film) Harum Scarum is a 1965 American musical comedy film starring Elvis Presley, which was shot on the original Cecil B. DeMille set from the film \"The King of Kings\" with additional footage shot on location at the Iverson Movie Ranch in Chatsworth, Calif. Some of the film was based on Rudolph Valentino's \"The Sheik\" released in 1921.

Paragraph 7: Vector 13 Vector 13 is a comic strip published in the British magazine \"2000 AD\". It featured the eponymous agency set up to investigate anomalous phenomena and conspiracy theories. It was influenced by American TV drama \"The X-Files\" (which was at the height of its popularity at the time) and other events like the 1995 release of the alien autopsy film; as the general interest in the paranormal and parapolitics waned, the series was wound up and replaced by \"Pulp Sci-Fi\" as a venue for single issue self-contained stories. In turn it foreshadowed other comics series dedicated to similar agencies, such as Caballistics, Inc. and the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense. Paragraph 8: Ant &amp; Dec Anthony McPartlin, OBE (born 18 November 1975) and Declan Donnelly, OBE (born 25 September 1975), known collectively as Ant & Dec, are an English comedy TV presenting, television producing, acting and former music duo from Newcastle upon Tyne, England.

Paragraph 10: William Davies (screenwriter) William Davies (sometimes credited William Davis or Will Davies) is an English screenwriter and film producer. He has written and co-written a number of films including 1988's \"Twins\", \"The Real McCoy\", \"Johnny English\", \"Alien Autopsy\", \"Flushed Away\", \"How to Train Your Dragon\", \"Johnny English Reborn\" and \"Puss in Boots\".

      "2024-02-13 22:30:15,382 - INFO - Paragraph 1: Albert Speer Berthold Konrad Hermann Albert Speer ( ; ] ; March 19, 1905 – September 1, 1981) was a German architect who was, for most of World War II, Reich Minister of Armaments and War Production for Nazi Germany. Speer was Adolf Hitler's chief architect before assuming ministerial office. As \"the Nazi who said sorry\", he accepted moral responsibility at the Nuremberg trials and in his memoirs for complicity in crimes of the Nazi regime, while insisting he had been ignorant of the Holocaust. Paragraph 2: Hermann Giesler Hermann Giesler (April 2, 1898, Siegen – January 20, 1987, Düsseldorf) was a German architect during the Nazi era, one of the two architects most favoured and rewarded by Adolf Hitler (the other being Albert Speer). Paragraph 3: Minister of Materials The Minister of Materials was a short-lived ministerial office in the Government of the United Kingdom, in charge of the Ministry of Materials. Created on 6 July 1951, the office was wound up on 16 August 1954. Most of its holders also held another ministerial office. Paragraph 4: Animal welfare in Nazi Germany There was widespread support for animal welfare in Nazi Germany among the country's leadership. Adolf Hitler and his top officials took a variety of measures to ensure animals were protected. Many Nazi leaders, including Hitler and Hermann Göring, were supporters of animal rights and conservation. Several Nazis were environmentalists, and species protection and animal welfare were significant issues in the Nazi regime. Heinrich Himmler made an effort to ban the hunting of animals. Göring was a professed animal lover and conservationist, who, on instructions from Hitler, committed Germans who violated Nazi animal welfare laws to concentration camps. In his private diaries, Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels described Hitler as a vegetarian whose hatred of the Jewish and Christian religions in large part stemmed from the ethical distinction these faiths drew between the value of humans and the value of other animals; Goebbels also mentions that Hitler planned to ban slaughterhouses in the German Reich following the conclusion of World War II. Paragraph 5: Personal standard of Adolf Hitler The personal standard of Adolf Hitler was designed after Reichspräsident Paul von Hindenburg died on 2 August 1934. Adolf Hitler abolished the title \"Reichspräsident\" and in its place instituted the title of \"Führer\" which henceforth could only be used when referring to him personally. Hindenburg used a personal standard consisting of a black eagle on a square gold background edged by a border of black, white and red bands. Hitler decided on 19 August 1934 to adopt a personal standard for himself, which was called \"Personal standard for Adolf Hitler as Leader and Chancellor of the German Nation\". As he was also Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces it was somewhat later known as \"The personal standard for Adolf Hitler as Leader and Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces\" (German: \"Standarte des Führers und Obersten Befehlshabers der Wehrmacht\"). Paragraph 6: Fuhrer city A Fuhrer city, or Führerstadt in German, was a status given to five German cities in 1937 by Adolf Hitler, the dictator of Nazi Germany. The status was based on Hitler's vision of undertaking gigantic urban transformation projects in these cities based on his own conceptions as executed by German architects including Albert Speer, Paul Ludwig Troost, German Bestelmeyer, Konstanty Gutschow, Hermann Giesler, Leonhard Gall and Paul Otto August Baumgarten. More modest reconstruction projects were to take place in thirty-five other cities, although some sources assert this number was as high as fifty. These plans were however not realised for the greater part because of the onset of the Second World War, although construction continued to take place even in wartime circumstances at Hitler's insistence. Paragraph 7: Hitler: Memoirs of a Confidant Hitler: Memoirs of a Confidant are the published memoirs written by Otto Wagener about Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party's early history. A German major general by the end for World War II and, for a period, Wagener was Adolf Hitler's party economist, chief of staff of the SA, and confidant, whose career was derailed by rival Hermann Göring. Wagener wrote his memoirs in 1946 while being held by the British, filling “thirty-six British military exercise notebooks.” His work was not published until seven years after his death, in 1978 in German. The English edition was published in 1985 by Yale University Press. His memoirs are used, to some degree, by Third Reich historians. Paragraph 8: Aryan Games The Aryan Games (German: \"Arische Spiele\" ) were a proposed replacement for the Olympic Games in the Third Reich. Proposed by Nazi sports organizer Carl Diem and subsequently adopted by Adolf Hitler, these multi-sport games were supposed to be housed permanently in Nuremberg at the planned \"German Stadium\", that had been designed by Nazi architect Albert Speer, but was never built. Paragraph 9: Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler order of battle The Leibstandarte SS \"Adolf Hitler\" (LSSAH) was founded in September 1933 as Adolf Hitler's personal Bodyguard formation. It was given the title \"Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler\" (LAH) in November, 1933. On 13 April 1934, by order of Himmler, the regiment became known as the \"Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler\" (LSSAH). In 1939 the LSSAH became a separate unit of the Waffen-SS aside the SS-TV and the SS-VT. Paragraph 10: Advanced School of the NSDAP The Advanced School of the NSDAP (German: \"Hohe Schule der NSDAP\" , literally \"High School of the NSDAP\") was a project by the chief ideologist of the Nazi Party Alfred Rosenberg to create an elite Nazi university, a kind of academy for party officials. A monumental central university building was to be built on the shores of Lake Chiemsee, based on the architectural plans of Hermann Giesler. Q: The Nazi architect that was most rewarded and favoured by Adolf Hitler alongside Hermann Giesler held what type of ministerial office?\n"

      "2024-02-13 22:30:17,400 - INFO - Paragraph 1: Siege of Béxar The Siege of Béxar (or Bejar) was an early campaign of the Texas Revolution in which a volunteer Texian army defeated Mexican forces at San Antonio de Béxar (now San Antonio, Texas, US). Texians had become disillusioned with the Mexican government as President and General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna's tenure became increasingly dictatorial. In early October, 1835, Texas settlers gathered in Gonzales to stop Mexican troops from reclaiming a small cannon. The resulting skirmish, known as the Battle of Gonzales, launched the Texas Revolution. Men continued to assemble in Gonzales and soon established the Texian Army. Despite a lack of military training, well-respected local leader General Stephen F. Austin was elected commander. Paragraph 2: Fort Bend Fort Bend was a blockhouse built in a large bend of the Brazos River in what is now Fort Bend County, Texas, to provide protection against Indian raids. It was erected in November 1822 by several members of Stephen F. Austin's Old Three Hundred, including William W. Little, Joseph Polley, William Smithers[Smeathers], Charles Beard, Henry Holster and is described as a \"little log shanty.\" The location was reportedly selected by Austin, and a settlement soon grew up around the post. As the site provided one of the more favorable fords of the Brazos River, it became important during the Texas Revolution. The Fort Bend crossing was briefly defended in April 1836 by a rear guard detachment led by Wiley Martin. After Martin was maneuvered out of the position Gen. Antonio López de Santa Anna transported a portion of his Mexican army across the Brazos at the crossing. After Santa Anna's defeat at the battle of San Jacinto the site was used briefly by the Texas army. Troops under Thomas Jefferson Green, who were in pursuit of retreating Mexican forces led by Gen. Vicente Filisola, halted for a short time in mid-May 1836 at Fort Bend. Because Fort Bend had been the center of activity in the area its name was given to the county when it was established in 1837. The next year nearby Richmond, Texas was selected as the county seat and soon absorbed the smaller Fort Bend settlement. In 1936 the Texas Centennial Commission erected a monument to commemorate Fort Bend's role in the Texas Revolution. Paragraph 3: José de Urrea José de Urrea (March 19, 1797 – August 1, 1849) was a Mexican general. He fought under General Antonio López de Santa Anna during the Texas Revolution. Urrea's forces were never defeated in battle during the Texas Revolution. His most notable success was that of the Goliad Campaign, in which James Fannin's 400 soldiers were surrounded and induced to capitulate under terms, but were massacred in Urrea's absence on the orders of Santa Anna. Urrea also fought in the Mexican-American War. Paragraph 4: Battle of San Jacinto The Battle of San Jacinto, fought on April 21, 1836, in present-day Harris County, Texas, was the decisive battle of the Texas Revolution. Led by General Sam Houston, the Texian Army engaged and defeated General Antonio López de Santa Anna's Mexican army in a fight that lasted just 18 minutes. Paragraph 5: Grass Fight The Grass Fight was a small battle during the Texas Revolution, fought between the Mexican Army and the Texian Army. The battle took place on November 26, 1835, just south of San Antonio de Béxar in the Mexican region of Texas. The Texas Revolution had officially begun on October 2 and by the end of the month the Texian had initiated a siege of Béxar, home of the largest Mexican garrison in the province. Bored with the inactivity, many of the Texian soldiers returned home; a smaller number of adventurers from the United States arrived to replace them. After the Texian Army rejected commander-in-chief Stephen F. Austin's call to launch an assault on Béxar on November 22, Austin resigned from the army. The men elected Edward Burleson their new commander-in-chief. Paragraph 6: Runaway Scrape The Runaway Scrape events took place mainly between September 1835 and April 1836, and were the evacuations by Texas residents fleeing the Mexican Army of Operations during the Texas Revolution, from the Battle of the Alamo through the decisive Battle of San Jacinto. The \"ad interim\" government of the new Republic of Texas and much of the civilian population fled eastward ahead of the Mexican forces. The conflict arose after Antonio López de Santa Anna abrogated the 1824 constitution of Mexico and established martial law in Coahuila y Tejas. The Texians resisted and declared their independence. It was Sam Houston's responsibility, as the appointed commander-in-chief of the Provisional Army of Texas (before such an army actually existed), to recruit and train a military force to defend the population against troops led by Santa Anna. Paragraph 7: Sarahville de Viesca, Texas Sarahville de Viesca or Fort Milam or Bucksnort is a ghost town in Falls County, Texas, United States. The settlement was established in 1834 by Sterling C. Robertson and named for his mother Mrs. Sarah (née Maclin) Robertson and Agustín Viesca, the Mexican governor of Coahuila y Tejas. The site was located at the falls of the Brazos River, where the river formerly dropped 10 ft and where a well-used ford was located. The town was temporarily deserted in 1836 during the Runaway Scrape and permanently abandoned soon afterward because of native American raids. Fort Milam was built on the west-bank site but abandoned a few years later in favor of the town of Bucksnort which occupied the east bank. Bucksnort vanished when the nearby town of Marlin was founded. There is a county park and historical marker located where Farm to Market Road 712 crosses the Brazos south of Marlin. Paragraph 8: Army of the Republic of Texas The Army of the Republic of Texas was the land-based component of the armed forces for the Republic of Texas. It directly descended from the Texian Army, which was established on October 2, 1835, to fight for independence from Mexico in the Texas Revolution. The army was provisionally formed from the Consultation in November 1835, and officially established on September 5, 1836, from Article II, Section 5 of the Constitution of the Republic of Texas. After Texas' annexation by the United States, the Army of the Republic of Texas was merged into the United States Army. Today, the 141st Infantry Regiment trace their lineage back to the Texas Revolution. Paragraph 9: 2013 Texas Revolution season The 2013 Texas Revolution season was the team's fourteenth season as a football franchise, fourth in the Indoor Football League (IFL), and first as the \"Texas Revolution\". One of just nine teams competing in the IFL for the 2013 season, the Texas Revolution were realigned to the United Conference. The team played their home games at the Allen Event Center in Allen, Texas. Head coach Billy Back led the team to a 5–9 record and they failed to qualify for post-season play. Paragraph 10: 2014 Texas Revolution season The 2014 Texas Revolution season was the team's fifteenth season as a professional indoor football franchise, fifth in the Indoor Football League (IFL), and second as the \"Texas Revolution\". One of nine teams in the IFL for the 2014 season, the Texas Revolution competed in the United Conference for the second consecutive year. The team played their home games at the Allen Event Center in Allen, Texas. Chris Williams returned to the IFL as the Texas Revolution's director of football operations and head coach for 2014. The team started strong but faltered, compiling a 3–11 record and missing the playoffs. In the post-season, Williams resigned and the team announced their departure from the IFL.

      "2024-02-13 22:30:18,735 - INFO - Paragraph 1: Elijah Elijah (, meaning \"My God is Yahu/Jah\") or Elias ( ; Greek: Ηλίας \"Elías\"; Syriac: ܐܸܠܝܼܵܐ‎ \"Elyāe\"; Arabic: إلياس or إليا, \"Ilyās\" or \"Ilyā\") was a prophet and a miracle worker who lived in the northern kingdom of Israel during the reign of Ahab (9th century BC), according to the Books of Kings in the Hebrew Bible. In 1 Kings 18, Elijah defended the worship of the Jewish God over that of the Canaanite deity Baal. God also performed many miracles through Elijah, including resurrection (raising the dead), bringing fire down from the sky, and entering Heaven alive \"by a whirlwind\". He is also portrayed as leading a school of prophets known as \"the sons of the prophets\". Following his ascension, Elisha his disciple and most devoted assistant took over his role as leader of this school. The Book of Malachi prophesies Elijah's return \"before the coming of the great and terrible day of the LORD\", making him a harbinger of the Messiah and of the eschaton in various faiths that revere the Hebrew Bible. References to Elijah appear in Ecclesiasticus, the New Testament, the Mishnah and Talmud, the Quran, the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and Bahá'í writings. Paragraph 2: Lot in Islam Lut ibn Haran (Arabic: لوط‎ , \"Lūṭ \" ‎ ), known as Lot in the Old Testament, is a prophet of God in the Quran. He also appears in the Bible, but the biblical stories of Lot are not entirely accepted within Islam. According to Islamic tradition, Lot lived in Ur and was the son of Haran and nephew of Abraham. He migrated with Abraham to Canaan. He was bestowed as a prophet to the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. He was commanded by God to go to the land of Sodom and Gomorrah to preach to his people on monotheism and to stop them from their lustful and violent acts. According to both the Quran and the Hebrew Bible, Lot's messages were ignored by the inhabitants and Sodom and Gomorrah were subsequently destroyed. Their sites cannot be exactly located, but it may be supposed that they were somewhere in the plain east of the Dead Sea or underneath its current limits. Lot's story is traditionally presented as an Islamic view against rape and homosexual acts. Paragraph 3: Serpents in the Bible Serpents (Hebrew: נחש‎ ‎ \"nāḥāš\") are referred to in both the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament. The symbol of a serpent or snake played important roles in religious and cultural life of ancient Egypt, Canaan, Mesopotamia and Greece. The serpent was a symbol of evil power and chaos from the underworld as well as a symbol of fertility, life and healing. \"Nachash\", Hebrew for \"snake\", is also associated with divination, including the verb-form meaning to practice divination or fortune-telling. In the Hebrew Bible, \"Nachash\" occurs in the Torah to identify the serpent in Eden. Throughout the Hebrew Bible, it is also used in conjunction with \"saraph\" to describe vicious serpents in the wilderness. \"Tanniyn\", a form of dragon-monster, also occurs throughout the Hebrew Bible. In the Book of Exodus, the staffs of Moses and Aaron are turned into serpents, a \"nachash\" for Moses, a \"tanniyn\" for Aaron. In the New Testament, the Book of Revelation makes use of \"ancient serpent\" and \"the Dragon\" several times to identify Satan or the devil. (; ) The serpent is most often identified with the hubristic Satan, and sometimes with Lilith. Paragraph 4: Biblical and Quranic narratives The Quran, the central religious text of Islam, contains references to more than fifty people and events also found in the Bible. While the stories told in each book are generally comparable in most respects, important differences sometimes emerge. Many stories in the Bible are not mentioned at all in the Quran and many stories in the Quran are not mentioned in the Bible. Paragraph 5: Book of Nahum The Book of Nahum is the seventh book of the 12 minor prophets of the Hebrew Bible. It is attributed to the prophet Nahum, and was probably written in Jerusalem in the 7th century BC. Paragraph 6: Human rights in the Quran In its Arabic texts, the Quran is considered the primary source of authority by Muslims. The Quran is a relatively short book of 77,000 words that are divided into one hundred and fourteen chapters (Suras). A hundred and thirteen of the chapters of the Quran begin with an indication of the book’s intent (In the name of God the All- Compassionate and the Ever-Merciful). The book is largely concerned with establishing boundaries that Muslims are prohibited from transgressing. Within these boundaries the Quran treats human beings as equally valuable and endowed with certain rights by virtue of simply being human, hence Human rights. The rights bestowed upon humans in the Quran include the right to life and peaceful living, as well as the right to own, protect, and have property protected, Islamic economic jurisprudence. The Quran also contains rights for minority groups and women, as well as regulations of human interactions as between one another to the extent of dictating how Prisoners of war ought to be treated. Paragraph 7: Book of Judges The Book of Judges (Hebrew: \"Sefer Shoftim\" ספר שופטים) is the seventh book of the Hebrew Bible and the Christian Bible. It contains the history of the Biblical judges, the divinely inspired leaders whose direct knowledge of Yahweh allows them to act as champions for the Israelites against oppression by foreign rulers, and models of the wise and faithful behaviour required of them by their God Yahweh following the exodus from Egypt and the conquest of Canaan. The stories follow a consistent pattern: the people are unfaithful to Yahweh and he therefore delivers them into the hands of their enemies; the people repent and entreat Yahweh for mercy, which he sends in the form of a leader or champion (a \"judge\"); the judge delivers the Israelites from oppression and they prosper, but soon they fall again into unfaithfulness and the cycle is repeated. Scholars consider many of the stories in \"Judges\" to be the oldest in the Deuteronomistic history, with their major redaction dated to the 8th century BCE and with materials such as the Song of Deborah dating from much earlier, perhaps close to the period the book depicts. Paragraph 8: Talut Talut (Arabic: طالوت‎ ‎ , \"Ṭālūt\") is considered to be the Qur’anic name for Saul, as he was the \"Malik\" (Arabic: مَـلِـك‎ ‎ , King) of Israel, or Gideon, with the reasoning that the Quran references the same incident of the drinking from the river as that found in the Book of Judges (7:5-7), and other factors associated with the latter. Paragraph 9: Biblical allusions in Shakespeare According to Dr. Naseeb Shaheen, Shakespeare, in writing his plays, \"seldom borrows biblical references from his sources, even when those sources contain many references.\" Roy Battenhouse notes that the Shakespearean tragedy \"frequently echoes Bible language or paradigm, even when the play's setting is pagan.\" Similarly, Peter Milward notes that despite their secular appearance, Shakespeare's plays \"conceal an undercurrent of religious meaning which belongs to their deepest essence.\" Further, Milward maintains that although Shakespeare \"may have felt obliged by the circumstances of the Elizabethan stage to avoid Biblical or other religious subjects for his plays,\" such obligation \"did not prevent him from making full use of the Bible in dramatizing his secular sources and thus infusing into them a Biblical meaning.\" Milward continues that, in writing his plays (in particular, the tragedies), Shakespeare \"shows the universal relevance of the Bible both to the reality of human life 'in this harsh world' and to its ideal in the heart of God.\" Steven Marx suggests \"a thorough familiarity with the Scriptures\" is a prerequisite to understanding the Biblical references in the plays, and that the plays' references to the Bible \"illuminate fresh and surprising meanings in the biblical text.\" Marx further notes that \"it is possible that Shakespeare sometimes regarded his own role of playwright and performer as godlike, his own book as potent and capacious as 'The Book'.\" It is important to note, as a recent study points out “The diversity of versions reflected in Shakespeare’s writing indicates that ‘Shakespeare’s Bible’ cannot be taken for granted as unitary, since it consists of a network of different translations” Paragraph 10: Moses in Islam Mûsâ ibn 'Imran (Arabic: ٰمُوسَى‎ , \"Mūsā \" ‎ ) known as Moses in the Hebrew Bible, considered a prophet, messenger, and leader in Islam, is the most frequently mentioned individual in the Quran. In Islamic tradition, instead of introducing a new religion, Musa is regarded by Muslims as teaching and practicing the religion of his predecessors and confirming the scriptures and prophets before him. The Quran states that Moses was sent by God to the Pharaoh of Egypt and the Israelites for guidance and warning. Moses is mentioned more in the Quran than any other individual, and his life is narrated and recounted more than that of any other prophet. According to Islam, all Muslims must have faith in every prophet (\"nabi\") and messenger (\"rasul\") which includes Moses and his brother Aaron (\"Harun\"). The Quran states: Q: What is the seventh book of the Hebrew and Christina bible and also has Quran references to the river drinking experience?\n"

      "2024-02-13 22:30:20,426 - INFO - Paragraph 1: Block booking Block booking is a system of selling multiple films to a theater as a unit. Block booking was the prevailing practice among Hollywood's major studios from the turn of the 1930s until it was outlawed by the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in \"United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.\" (1948). Under block booking, \"independent ('unaffiliated') theater owners were forced to take large numbers of [a] studio's pictures sight unseen. Those studios could then parcel out second-rate product along with A-class features and star vehicles, which made both production and distribution operations more economical.\" The element of the system involving the purchase of unseen pictures is known as blind bidding. Paragraph 2: Baker v. Nelson Richard John Baker v. Gerald R. Nelson, 291 Minn. 310, 191 N.W.2d 185 (1971) is a case in which the Minnesota Supreme Court ruled that a state law limiting marriage to persons of the opposite sex did not violate the U.S. Constitution. Baker appealed, and on October 10, 1972, the United States Supreme Court dismissed the appeal \"for want of a substantial federal question.\" Because the case came to the U.S. Supreme Court through mandatory appellate review (not \"certiorari\"), the dismissal constituted a decision on the merits and established \"Baker v. Nelson\" as precedent, though the extent of its precedential effect had been subject to debate. In May 2013, Minnesota legalized same-sex marriage and it took effect on August 1, 2013. Subsequently, on June 26, 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court explicitly overruled \"Baker\" in \"Obergefell v. Hodges\" making same-sex marriage legal nationwide. Paragraph 3: United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc. United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc., 334 US 131 (1948) (also known as the Hollywood Antitrust Case of 1948, the Paramount Case, the Paramount Decision or the Paramount Decree) was a landmark United States Supreme Court antitrust case that decided the fate of movie studios owning their own theatres and holding exclusivity rights on which theatres would show their films. It would also change the way Hollywood movies were produced, distributed, and exhibited. The Court held in this case that the existing distribution scheme was in violation of the antitrust laws of the United States, which prohibit certain exclusive dealing arrangements. Paragraph 4: R v Van der Peet R v Van der Peet, [1996] 2 S.C.R. 507 is a leading case on Aboriginal rights under section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982. The Supreme Court held that Aboriginal fishing rights did not extend to commercial selling of fish. From this case came the Van der Peet test for determining if an Aboriginal right exists. This is the first of three cases known as the Van der Peet trilogy which included \"R v NTC Smokehouse Ltd\" and \"R v Gladstone\". Paragraph 5: United States v. Binion United States v. Binion, 132 F. App'x 89 (8th Cir. 2005), is a case in which the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit applied two recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions (\"United States v. Booker\", 543 U.S. 220 (2005) and \"United States v. Fanfan\", 543 U.S. 220 (2005) in reviewing the sentencing decision by the trial court and upheld by the Federal District Court for the Eastern District. Paragraph 6: Lau Kong Yung v Director of Immigration Lau Kong Yung v. Director of Immigration was a 1999 right of abode case in the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal following closely on the heels of the landmark \"Ng Ka Ling v. Director of Immigration\" decision earlier that year. After \"Ng\" and the two prior actions in \"Lau\", but before the case came before the CFA, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC) of the People's Republic of China issued an interpretation of the Basic Law which affected the rights of Lau and his fellow applicants. \"Lau\" thus became the first case in which the CFA had to take into account an NPCSC interpretation in applying the Basic Law. Paragraph 7: Craig v. Boren Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190 (1976) , was the first case in which a majority of the United States Supreme Court determined that statutory or administrative sex classifications were subject to intermediate scrutiny under the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. Paragraph 8: City of Norwood v. Horney Norwood, Ohio v. Horney 110 Ohio St.3d 353 was a case brought before the Ohio Supreme Court in 2006. The case came upon the heels of \"Kelo v. City of New London\", in which the United States Supreme Court ruled that commercial development justified the use of eminent domain. \"Kelo\" had involved the United States Constitution, while the issue in \"Norwood\" was the specific limitations of the Ohio State Constitution. Paragraph 9: Criminal law in the Waite Court During the tenure of Morrison Waite as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States (March 4, 1874 through March 23, 1888), the Supreme Court heard an unprecedented volume and frequency of criminal cases. In just fourteen years, the Court heard 106 criminal cases, almost as many cases as the Supreme Court had heard in the period from its creation to the appointment of Waite as Chief Justice. Notable cases include \"United States v. Cruikshank\" (1875), \"United States v. Reese\" (1875), \"Reynolds v. United States\" (1878), \"Wilkerson v. Utah\" (1879), the \"Trade-Mark Cases\" (1879), \"Strauder v. West Virginia\" (1880), \"Pace v. Alabama\" (1883), \"United States v. Harris\" (1883), \"Ex parte Crow Dog\" (1883), \"Hurtado v.

Paragraph 10: Criminal law in the Marshall Court The Marshall Court (1801–1835) heard forty-one criminal law cases, slightly more than one per year. Among such cases are \"United States v. Simms\" (1803), \"United States v. More\" (1805), \"Ex parte Bollman\" (1807), \"United States v. Hudson\" (1812), \"Cohens v. Virginia\" (1821), \"United States v. Perez\" (1824), \"Worcester v.

      "2024-02-13 22:30:23,644 - INFO - Paragraph 1: List of magazines in Malaysia The first women's magazine was published in Malaysia in 1932. In the 2000s there were nearly fifty local titles addressing women in the country. These magazines also include those having an Islamic perspective. Some international women's magazines are also published in Malaysia. One of them is \"Elle Malaysia\", which was first published in March 2014. Another one, \"Women’s Health\", was started in April 2015. Comic magazines and film magazines are also common in Malaysia. Paragraph 2: List of magazines in Austria The magazine sector in Austria is under the dominance of Germany. This influence decreased at the end of the 1990s, but it continued on the women's magazines and fashion magazines. However, business magazines have not been subject to the dominance of Germany. The major fields of Austrian magazines are news, popular science and special interest topics. On the other hand, since the Austrian press market is divided between magazines and newspapers, magazines have a significant function in the press market. Paragraph 3: Transition House Association of Nova Scotia The Transition House Association of Nova Scotia (abbreviated THANS and TRANS) is a Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada-based organisation that runs women's shelters. Pamela Harrison is THANS's executive director, and also serves as provincial co-ordinator. Rhonda Fraser, the executive director of Chrysalis House, is a member of THANS. THANS organises an annual purple ribbon awareness campaign in memory of the École Polytechnique massacre. THANS was founded in 1989. THANS conducted interviews with 34 physically abused women who subsequently sought resolution through family law mediation. In 2000, THANS released a report based on these interviews, stating that most of the women would not recommend legal mediation to other abused women. In 2008, THANS supported Bill 81, which they hoped would become the Domestic Violence Elimination Act, but Minister of Justice Cecil Clarke chose not to call the bill for a third reading. In 2009, Darrell Dexter of the New Democratic Party identified THANS in his promise to increase government funding of halfway houses in Nova Scotia. In 2012, THANS partnered with the World YWCA, Family SOS, Silent Witness Nova Scotia, and Leave Out Violence to host the Atlantic Ballet Theatre of Canada's \"Ghosts of Violence\", a ballet about domestic violence, in Halifax. Paragraph 4: Look (UK magazine) Look is a glossy high street fashion and celebrity weekly magazine for young women. It is published by Time Inc. UK, and edited by Ali Hall. The magazine focuses on fashion, high street shopping advice, celebrity style and news, and real-life stories. Paragraph 5: Lifestyle magazine Lifestyle magazine is an umbrella term for popular magazines concerned with lifestyle and is often used to encompass a number of men's magazines, women's magazines and magazines about health and fitness, tourism, leisure, fashion, decorating, or culture. The concept is chiefly used in reference to a magazine's tone. Paragraph 6: Customer magazine A customer magazine is a magazine produced by a business as a means of communicating to its customers. It is a branch of custom media, a product that broadly shares the look and feel of a newsstand or consumer magazine but is paid for in part or whole by a business. Rather than copy sales and advertising, the primary goal of a customer magazine is to achieve a particular business objective. This could be for a firm to cross- or up-sell, change brand perception or engender loyalty. In-flight magazines, sponsored by airlines, were among the first customer magazines, and remain typical of the genre. In the UK, every supermarket chain now provides a customer magazine to promote its products through recipes and other food editorial. Many prominent digitally-native companies, like WebMD and Net-À-Portér, have released customer magazines of their own. Some customer magazines carry advertising; this is often seen as a useful way to offset the cost but equally can have some benefit in making the product look more like a regular magazine. Paragraph 7: Chrysalis (magazine) Chrysalis: A Magazine of Women's Culture was a feminist publication produced from 1977 to 1980. The self-published magazine was founded by Kirsten Grimstad and Susan Rennie at the Woman's Building in downtown Los Angeles. \"Chysalis\" grew from Grimstad and Rennie's editorial work on the self-help resource books, The New Woman's Survival Catalog and The New Woman's Survival Sourcebook. \"Chrysalis\" distinguished itself from other feminist publications through an organic integration of politics, literature, cultural studies, and art. The magazine was produced through a collective process that grew out of the feminist practice of consciousness-raising. Unusually broad in scope, \"Chrysalis\" did not substitute breadth for quality. The authors, poets, essayists, and researchers contributing to the magazine reveals a veritable who's who of towering intellects of the feminist movement: black lesbian activist Audre Lorde; the magazine's poetry editor, Robin Morgan, who later served as editor of Ms. from 1990-1993: award winning poet Adrienne Rich; novelist Marge Percy; artist Judy Chicago; science fiction writer Joanna Russ; art critic Lucy Lippard, plus Mary Daly, Dolores Hayden, Andrea Dworkin, Marilyn Hacker, Arlene Raven, and Elizabeth Janeway. Over a three-year span, the all volunteer staff produced ten issues before they were forced to disband in 1981 due to financial difficulties. Paragraph 8: Rick Wilber Rick Wilber is an American author, poet, and editor. He has published more than thirty-five short stories in magazines such as \"Aboriginal SF\", \"Analog\", \"Asimov's Science Fiction\", \"Fantasy & Science Fiction\", \"Pulphouse\", and \"SF Age\"; and in anthologies such as \"Alien Sex\" and \"Chrysalis\". In addition to his short stories, he has written the novels \"Rum Point\", \"The Cold Road\", and \"Alien Morning\", as well as a memoir, \"My Father's Game: Life, Death, Baseball\", and several textbooks, including \"Modern Media Writing\" and \"Magazine Feature Writing\". Paragraph 9: List of magazines in Portugal Magazines in Portugal are mostly women's magazines, society magazines and TV magazines. In 1994 there were nearly 984 magazines in the country. Paragraph 10: Surfer hair Surfer hair is a tousled type of hairstyle, popularized by surfers from the 1950s onwards, traditionally long, thick and naturally bleached from high exposure to the sun and salt water of the sea. In the late 1960s and 1970s, the long hair and general lack of personal grooming was closely associated with hippie culture. Today, hairstyling companies brand their own hair gels, shampoos and hair wax to achieve the \"surfer look\", with hairstyles, often shorter than traditionally, which often require more grooming to achieve the permanent hair lift or intentional windswept look. Amongst women, fashion magazines have referred to \"sun streaked surfer hair\" as a desirable look for women, although genuine surfer hair is often heavily damaged by the elements. Q: Are  Chrysalis and Look both women's magazines?\n"

A nonfiction essay is a short, nonfiction narrative work of prose literature that is analytic, speculative, or interpretive in nature, dealing with or offering opinions or conjectures upon facts and reality, and written from the author’s point of view. On the Pleasure of Hating is seen as an essay because it is written to express Hazlitt’s point of view on the lack of sympathy that people have. For example, on page 189, Hazlitt proceeds to explain that,“We learn to curb our will and keep our overt actions within the bounds of humanity, long before we can subdue our sentiments and imaginations to the same mild tone.”Hazlitt gives this example as he is about to kill a spider. Hazlitt comes to the realization that the spider has done nothing to harm him. Why should he kill the innocent spider if the spider just means to be crawling from one place to another? Hazlitt tries to make the reader comprehend that society is the one that has placed pressure on hating things just to avoid us from hating ourselves.

Her debut album \"You\" was produced by Grammy Award winner Jesse Harris. Paragraph 8: Maafa Maafa (or African Holocaust, Holocaust of Enslavement, or Black holocaust as alternatives) are political neologisms (popularized from 1998 onwards) used to describe the history and ongoing effects of atrocities inflicted on African people, particularly when committed by non-Africans, specifically in the context of the history of slavery, including the Arab Slave Trade and Atlantic Slave Trade, and argued as \"continued to the present day\" through imperialism, colonialism, and other forms of oppression. For example, Maulana Karenga (2001) puts slavery in the broader context of the \"Maafa\", suggesting that its effects exceed mere physical persecution and legal disenfranchisement: the \"destruction of human possibility involved redefining African humanity to the world, poisoning past, present and future relations with others who only know us through this stereotyping and thus damaging the truly human relations among peoples.\" Paragraph 9: Cho Oh-hyun Seorak Musan Cho Oh Hyun (Hangul: 조오현) (born in 1932 in Miryang in South Gyeongsang Province of South Korea) has lived in the mountains since he became a novice monk at the age of seven. Over the years he has written over a hundred poems, including many in sijo form. In 2007 he received the Cheong Chi-yong Literary Award for his book Distant Holy Man. He is Josil of Kibon Seonwon (Spiritual Master of Fundamental Seon Mediation Center) of Jogye Order of the Korean Buddhism at Baekdamsa Monastery and famous for his Poetry of Delusion. He founded Manhae Foundation and Manhae Prize in Korea. He started his Seon Poetry career in 1966. Soon in 1977, he became the abbot of Sinheungsa Temple which is the 3rd Diocese of Jogye Order of the Korean Buddhism. His Books of Seon Poetry, Ten Ox-Herding was published in 1978, The Seon Anthology of Manak Gathas was published in 2002, A Remote Holy Man was published in 2007. Many authors have written on Seorak Musan Cho Oh Hyun. He became Josil of Kibon Seonwon (Spiritual Master of Fundamental Seon Mediation Center) of Jogye Order of the Korean Buddhism at Baekdamsa Monastery on 14 March 2014. He is renowned not only in South Korea but also in European and Asian countries like Germany, India, Sri Lanka, etc. for his poetry. He is also a painter. Lee (2011) described the Wisdom of the Social Awakening emerged in the Gathas of Searching the Bulls : centering on Musan Cho Oh-Hyun’s Gathas of Ten Ox Herding. He further elaborate that Seorak Musan Cho Oh-Hyun wrote Musan's Ten Ox Herding gathas as the process of his practice through Seon poems. He concluded that ox-herding story of Seorak Musan Cho Oh Hyun leads people to peaceful shelter to stop agony and awake the reality of the world truly. Ox-herding practice can be an alternative for awakening society. Lee (2013) discussed Musan Cho Oh Hyun and Ethics Education. He revealed that Musan Cho Oh Hyun’s approach to ethics education is humanistic. His teachings import the carriage of leading a life worthy of a human being. While embodying the transcendental ethics of Seon Buddhism, Musan teaches that in order to lead a truly human life, it is paramount for all mortals to respect the collective rules of communities. In his exposition of the Buddhist ethics, Musan shows a supple understanding that goes beyond Sila and Vinaya, the rules of daily Buddhist lives. Paragraph 10: Don't Know Why \"Don't Know Why\" is a song written by Jesse Harris which originally appeared on his 1999 album, \"Jesse Harris & the Ferdinandos\". It was the second single by American singer Norah Jones from her debut studio album \"Come Away with Me\" (2002). Jones's version peaked at No. 30 on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and was a critical success, helping establish her as a respected new artist, and subsequently her album sold extremely well. The single went on to win three Grammy Awards in 2003 for Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. It remains Jones's biggest hit single in the United States to date, and her only one to reach the top 40 of the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. The single was also a hit internationally and reached top 10 in several countries. The song charted at 459 in \"Blender\" magazine's 500 Greatest Songs Since You Were Born. Q: In which year was the author born that wrote about  the former succubus Jezebel, now the mortal Jesse Harris, as she tries to avoid her Hellish past and learn how to be truly human?\n"

      "2024-02-13 22:30:27,800 - INFO - Paragraph 1: Variable universal life insurance Variable universal life insurance (often shortened to VUL) is a type of life insurance that builds a cash value. In a VUL, the cash value can be invested in a wide variety of separate accounts, similar to mutual funds, and the choice of which of the available separate accounts to use is entirely up to the contract owner. The 'variable' component in the name refers to this ability to invest in separate accounts whose values vary—they vary because they are invested in stock and/or bond markets. The 'universal' component in the name refers to the flexibility the owner has in making premium payments. The premiums can vary from nothing in a given month up to maximums defined by the Internal Revenue Code for life insurance. This flexibility is in contrast to whole life insurance that has fixed premium payments that typically cannot be missed without lapsing the policy (although one may exercise an Automatic Premium Loan feature, or surrender dividends to pay a Whole Life premium). Paragraph 2: John Douglas Pringle Award John Douglas Pringle Award or British Prize for Journalism is offered jointly by the British High Commission and the Australian National Press Club. It is named after a distinguished journalist, John Douglas Pringle. Paragraph 3: Whole life insurance Whole life insurance, or whole of life assurance (in the Commonwealth of Nations), sometimes called \"straight life\" or \"ordinary life,\" is a life insurance policy which is guaranteed to remain in force for the insured's entire lifetime, provided required premiums are paid, or to the maturity date. As a life insurance policy it represents a contract between the insured and insurer that as long as the contract terms are met, the insurer will pay the death benefit of the policy to the policy's beneficiaries when the insured dies. Because whole life policies are guaranteed to remain in force as long as the required premiums are paid, the premiums are typically much higher than those of term life insurance where the premium is fixed only for a limited term. Whole life premiums are fixed, based on the age of issue, and usually do not increase with age. The insured party normally pays premiums until death, except for limited pay policies which may be paid-up in 10 years, 20 years, or at age 65. Whole life insurance belongs to the cash value category of life insurance, which also includes universal life, variable life, and endowment policies. Paragraph 4: Hormonal imprinting Hormonal imprinting (HI) is a phenomenon which takes place at the first encounter between a hormone and its developing receptor in the critical periods of life (in unicellulars during the whole life) and determines the later signal transduction capacity of the cell. The most important period in mammals is the perinatal one, however this system can be imprinted at weaning, at puberty and in case of continuously dividing cells during the whole life. Faulty imprinting is caused by drugs, environmental pollutants and other hormone-like molecules present in excess at the critical periods with lifelong receptorial, morphological, biochemical and behavioral consequences. HI is transmitted to the hundreds of progeny generations in unicellulars and (as proved) to a few generations also in mammals. Paragraph 5: John Douglas, 7th Marquess of Queensberry John Douglas, 7th Marquess of Queensberry (1779 – 19 December 1856), styled Lord John Douglas from May to December 1837, was a Scottish Whig politician. Paragraph 6: Gibson's albatross Gibson's albatross (\"Diomedea antipodensis gibsoni\"), also known as the Auckland Islands wandering albatross or Gibson's wandering albatross, is a large seabird in the great albatross group of the albatross family. The common name and trinomial commemorate John Douglas Gibson, an Australian amateur ornithologist who studied albatrosses off the coast of New South Wales for thirty years. Paragraph 7: Gibson Plumage Index The Gibson Plumage Index (GPI), sometimes known as the Gibson Code, is a system for describing the plumage of great albatrosses. It is named after, and originally devised in the late 1950s by, John Douglas Gibson and other members of the New South Wales Albatross Study Group. Gibson was an Australian amateur ornithologist who carried out fieldwork on albatrosses along the coast of New South Wales for thirty years. The index assigns separate numerical values (from 1 to 6 with increasing proportion of white) to the degrees of colouration on four parts of the body - the back, head, inner wing and tail - of albatrosses to indicate variations in age and between different breeding populations. For instance, a bird with a completely brown back would receive a score of 1 for the back, while a bird with an all-white back would be scored as a 6. The index was later expanded by Pierre Jouventin and colleagues to cover the more complex patterning of the Amsterdam albatross, adding belly and tibial feather colouration. This system for categorising the wide and complex variation in appearance of great albatrosses has been instrumental in the discovery of several genetically isolated populations and consequent description of new taxa, and has made field identification easier. Paragraph 8: John Douglas Gibson John Douglas (Doug) Gibson ( – 21 May 1984) lived in Thirroul, New South Wales all his life, and worked at the nearby Port Kembla steelworks. He was a notable Australian amateur ornithologist who became an internationally respected expert on the Diomedeidae or albatross family. Paragraph 9: Thirroul, New South Wales Thirroul is a northern seaside suburb of the city of Wollongong, Australia. Situated between Austinmer and Bulli, it is approximately 13 kilometres north of Wollongong, and 69 km south of Sydney. It lies between the Pacific Ocean and a section of the Illawarra escarpment known as Lady Fuller Park, adjacent to Bulli Pass Scenic Reserve. Paragraph 10: Too Much Happiness Too Much Happiness is a short story collection by Canadian writer Alice Munro, published on August 25, 2009 by McClelland and Stewart's Douglas Gibson Books imprint. Q: John Douglas Gibson lived his whole life in a suburb of what city?\n"

      "2024-02-13 22:30:29,005 - INFO - Paragraph 1: Premenstrual water retention Premenstrual water retention (or premenstrual fluid retention) is a common phenomenon associated with the menstrual cycle. It consists of the retention of water during the period of time immediately preceding the menstrual cycle (that is, the latter half of the luteal phase, or the week before menstruation). This water retention is most noticeable for its temporary enlargement of the breasts. The excess fluid is lost during menstruation. During this event, the water retention can store enough extra fluid to add an extra 5 – of weight. The phenomenon is thought to be caused by high levels of circulating progesterone, as well as of estrogen and prolactin, stimulating secretory cells in the body and in the breasts. In the breasts, increased blood flow is also thought to be involved. Water retention and breast swelling can also be caused by hormonal contraceptives (which contain estrogen and/or a progestogen). Paragraph 2: Sundowning Sundowning, or sundown syndrome, is a neurological phenomenon associated with increased confusion and restlessness in patients with delirium or some form of dementia. Most commonly associated with Alzheimer's disease, but also found in those with other forms of dementia, the term \"sundowning\" was coined due to the timing of the patient's confusion. For patients with sundowning syndrome, a multitude of behavioral problems begin to occur in the evening or while the sun is setting. Sundowning seems to occur more frequently during the middle stages of Alzheimer's disease and mixed dementia. Patients are generally able to understand that this behavioral pattern is abnormal. Sundowning seems to subside with the progression of a patient's dementia. Research shows that 20–45% of Alzheimer's patients will experience some sort of sundowning confusion. Paragraph 3: Thunderbird (cryptozoology) Thunderbird is a term used in cryptozoology to describe large, bird-like creatures, generally identified with the Thunderbird of Native American tradition. Similar cryptids reported in the Old World are often called Rocs. Thunderbirds are regarded by a small number of researchers as having lizard features like the extinct pterosaurs such as \"Pteranodon\". Reports of Thunderbird sightings go back centuries, and the fossil record does show that giant birds (teratorns) with wingspans between 12 and were likely contemporary with early man. Today the creature is generally regarded as a myth. Paragraph 4: Patagonia picnic table effect The Patagonia picnic table effect (also known as the Patagonia rest area effect or Patagonia rest stop effect) is a phenomenon associated with birding in which an influx of birdwatchers following the discovery of a rare bird at a location results in the discovery of further rare birds at that location, and so on, with the end result being that the locality becomes well known for rare birds, even though in itself it may be little or no better than other similar localities. Paragraph 5: Ice-marginal lava flow An ice marginal lava flow is a phenomenon associated with glaciovolcanism. Glaciovolcanism is the study of volcano and ice interaction, so essentially any and all volcanic activity that interacts with any sort of ice formation The science of glaciovolcanism relatively young in age because, to study it, people must overcome hostile environments. While young, the science of glaciovolcanism can give us clues to in order to reconstruct volcanoes from the past and answer questions regarding whether or not ice was present in a certain area, the thickness of the ice, the surface elevation of the ice sheet and finally the structure of the ice sheet. Glaciovolcanism is increasingly important for volcanic hazard awareness and preparedness, studying the Pleistocene climate record, possible relationships between deglaciation and volcanism, and finally possible Martian geoscience research. Paragraph 6: Separation (statistics) In statistics, separation is a phenomenon associated with models for dichotomous or categorical outcomes, including logistic and probit regression. Separation occurs if the predictor (or a linear combination of some subset of the predictors) is associated with only one outcome value when the predictor is greater than some constant. Paragraph 7: Cold drop The cold drop (Spanish: \"gota fría\" ) is a weather phenomenon often occurring in the Spanish autumn. It is experienced particularly along the western Mediterranean and as such, most frequently affects the east coast of Spain. It is a closed upper-level low which has become completely displaced (cut off) from basic westerly current, and moves independently of that current. Cutoff lows may remain nearly stationary for days, or on occasion may move westward opposite to the prevailing flow aloft (i.e., retrogression). The term is also used to describe the meteorological phenomenon associated. In Spain, it appears when a front of very cold polar air, a jet stream, advances slowly over Western Europe, at high altitude (normally 5–9 km or 3–5.5 mi). Paragraph 8: Bridgewater Triangle The Bridgewater Triangle refers to an area of about 200 mi2 within southeastern Massachusetts in the United States, claimed to be a site of alleged paranormal phenomena, ranging from UFOs to poltergeists, orbs, balls of fire and other spectral phenomena, various bigfoot-like sightings, giant snakes and \"thunderbirds.\" Paragraph 9: Bennington Triangle \"Bennington Triangle\" is a phrase coined by New England author Joseph A. Citro during a public radio broadcast in 1992 to denote an area of southwestern Vermont within which a number of people went missing between 1920 and 1950. This was further popularized in two books, including \"Shadow Child\", in which he devoted chapters to discussion of these disappearances and various items of folklore surrounding the area. According to Citro, the area shares characteristics with the Bridgewater Triangle in neighboring Massachusetts. Paragraph 10: Diffraction in time Diffraction in time is a phenomenon associated with the quantum dynamics of suddenly released matter waves initially confined in a region of space. Q: Bridgewater Triangle is an area where the phenomenon associated with what type of tradition has been seen?\n"

The role of Miriam Hodges was originally offered to June Allyson. Paragraph 3: Us (film) Us is a 1991 television movie broadcast on CBS, produced, written and directed by Michael Landon. Landon also starred in the film, along with Barney Martin and Casey Peterson. It was a pilot for what would have been Landon's fourth consecutive television series; Landon's death that year precluded its going ahead. Landon played Jeff Hayes, a man just released from prison after serving many years due to being wrongfully convicted of killing a wealthy man's wife. Paragraph 4: Anna and the King of Siam (film) Anna and the King of Siam is a 1946 drama film directed by John Cromwell. An adaptation of the 1944 novel of the same name by Margaret Landon, it was based on the fictionalized diaries of Anna Leonowens, an Anglo-Indian woman who claimed to be British and became governess in the Royal Court of Siam (now modern Thailand) during the 1860s. Darryl F. Zanuck read Landon's book in galleys and immediately bought the film rights. Paragraph 5: Mary Elizabeth Bliss Mary Elizabeth \"Betty\" Taylor Bliss Dandridge, born Mary Elizabeth Taylor (April 20, 1824 – July 25, 1909), was the youngest of the three surviving daughters of President Zachary Taylor (1849-1850) and Margaret Mackall Smith Taylor. Paragraph 6: The King and I (1956 film) The King and I is a 1956 American musical film made by 20th Century Fox, directed by Walter Lang and produced by Charles Brackett and Darryl F. Zanuck. The screenplay by Ernest Lehman is based on the Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II musical \"The King and I\", based in turn on the novel \"Anna and the King of Siam\" by Margaret Landon. That novel in turn was based on memoirs written by Anna Leonowens, who became school teacher to the children of King Mongkut of Siam in the early 1860s. Leonowens' stories were autobiographical, although various elements of them have been called into question. The film stars Deborah Kerr and Yul Brynner. Paragraph 7: Krupp Diamond The Elizabeth Taylor Diamond, formerly known as the Krupp Diamond, is a 33.19 carat diamond that was bought by Richard Burton for his wife, Elizabeth Taylor in 1968. The Krupp diamond was one of a number of significant pieces of jewellery owned by Taylor, her collection also included the 68 carat Taylor–Burton Diamond, which was bought by the couple in 1969. The Krupp diamond was sold by Taylor's estate in 2011 for $8.8 million. Paragraph 8: Margaret Landon Margaret Landon (September 7, 1903 – December 4, 1993) was an American writer best remembered for \"Anna and the King of Siam\", her best-selling 1944 novel of the life of Anna Leonowens which eventually sold over a million copies and was translated into more than twenty languages. In 1950, Landon sold the musical play rights to Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II, who created the musical \"The King and I\" from her book. A later work, \"Never Dies the Dream\", appeared in 1949. Paragraph 9: The King and I The King and I is the fifth musical by the team of composer Richard Rodgers and dramatist Oscar Hammerstein II. It is based on Margaret Landon's novel, \"Anna and the King of Siam\" (1944), which is in turn derived from the memoirs of Anna Leonowens, governess to the children of King Mongkut of Siam in the early 1860s. The musical's plot relates the experiences of Anna, a British schoolteacher hired as part of the King's drive to modernize his country. The relationship between the King and Anna is marked by conflict through much of the piece, as well as by a love to which neither can admit. The musical premiered on March 29, 1951, at Broadway's St. James Theatre. It ran for nearly three years, making it the fourth longest-running Broadway musical in history at the time, and has had many tours and revivals. Paragraph 10: Elizabeth Taylor Dame Elizabeth Rosemond Taylor, DBE (February 27, 1932 – March 23, 2011) was a British-American actress, businesswoman, and humanitarian. She began her career as a child actress in the early 1940s, and was one of the most popular stars of classical Hollywood cinema in the 1950s. She continued her career successfully into the 1960s, and remained a well known public figure for the rest of her life. In 1999, the American Film Institute named her the seventh-greatest female screen legend. Q: Who starred in more films Margaret Landon or Elizabeth Taylor?\n"

      "2024-02-13 22:30:46,081 - INFO - Paragraph 1: DF-224 The DF-224 is a space-qualified computer used in space missions from the 1980s. It was built by Rockwell Autonetics. As with many spacecraft computers, the design is very redundant, since servicing in space is at best difficult and often impossible. The configuration had three CPUs, one active and two spares. The main memory consisted of six memory units, each with 8K 24-bit words of plated wire memory, with up to 48K words total. Four memory modules could be powered up at one time, resulting in a maximum of 32K words of available memory, though some applications such as the Hubble Space Telescope used fewer memory banks to allow for graceful failure modes. There were three I/O processors, one operational and two backups. The power supply consisted of 6 independent power converters, with overlapping coverage of the operating functions. The processor used fixed-point arithmetic with a two's complement format. Paragraph 2: Dubna 48K The Dubna 48K (Дубна 48К) is a Soviet clone of the ZX Spectrum home computer. It was based on an analogue of the Zilog Z80 microprocessor. Its name comes from Dubna, a town near Moscow where it was produced, and \"48K\" stands for 48 KBs of RAM. Paragraph 3: HP Saturn The Saturn family of 4-bit microprocessors was developed by Hewlett-Packard in the 1980s for programmable scientific calculators/microcomputers. It succeeded the \"Nut\" family of processors used in earlier calculators. The original Saturn chipset was first used in the HP-71B hand-held BASIC-programmable computer, introduced in 1984. Later models of the family powered the popular HP 48 series of calculators, among others. The HP 49 series initially used the Saturn CPU as well, until the NEC fab could no longer manufacture the processor for technical reasons in 2003. Therefore, starting with the HP 49g+ model in 2003, the calculators switched to use a Samsung S3C2410 processor with ARM920T core (part of the ARMv4T architecture) to run an emulator of the Saturn architecture in software. In 2000, the HP 39G and HP 40G were the last calculators introduced based on the Saturn hardware. The last calculators based on the Saturn emulator were the HP 39gs, HP 40gs and HP 50g in 2006, as well as the 2007 revision of the hp 48gII. The HP 50g, the last calculator utilizing this emulator, was discontinued in 2015 when Samsung stopped producing the ARM processor it was based on. Paragraph 4: Nuclotron Nuclotron is the world's first superconductive synchrotron, exploited by the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, Russia. This particle accelerator is based on a miniature iron-shaped field superconductive magnets, and has a particle energy up to 7 GeV. It was built in 1987-1992 as a part of Dubna synchrophasotron modernisation program (the Nuclotron ring follows the outer perimeter of the synchrophasotron ring). 5 runs of about 1400 hours total duration have been provided by the present time. The most important experiments tested the cryomagnetic system of a novel type, and obtained data on nuclear collisions using internal target. Paragraph 5: TEC-1 The TEC-1 is a single-board kit computer first produced by the Australian hobbyist electronics magazine Talking Electronics in the early 1980s. It was based on the Zilog Z80 CPU, had 2K of RAM and 2K of ROM in a default configuration. Later versions used a 4k ROM with two different versions of the monitor software selectable via a switch. This allowed the early software presented in the magazine to be used with the later version of the TEC-1. Paragraph 6: Mugsy (video game) Mugsy is a strategy and management computer game for the 48K ZX Spectrum. It was well-received, mainly due to its innovative graphic style, and was followed two years later by a sequel. Paragraph 7: Space Defender Space Defender is a fixed shooter game for the Apple II computer, created by Daniel Schuyler and published by Bel-Air Software in 1982. It requires an Apple II with a minimum of 48K RAM. Paragraph 8: Knight Tyme Knight Tyme is a computer game released for the ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64 and MSX compatibles in 1986. It was published by Mastertronic as part of their Mastertronic Added Dimension label. Two versions of the ZX Spectrum release were published: a full version for the 128K Spectrum (which was published first) and a cut-down version for the 48K Spectrum that removed the music, some graphics and some locations (which was published later). Paragraph 9: Hareraiser Hareraiser is a computer game, originally released in 1984 in the UK for most home computer platforms. It was released in two parts; \"Prelude\" and \"Finale\". A prize worth £30,000 was on offer if the game could be solved. The game was released on Acorn Electron, Amstrad CPC, BBC Micro Model B, Commodore 64, Commodore VIC-20 EX, Dragon 32, MSX, Oric Atmos 48k and Sinclair ZX Spectrum in 1984 at £8.95 for each part. Paragraph 10: Atic Atac Atic Atac is an arcade-adventure video game developed and published by Ultimate Play the Game, released for the ZX Spectrum and the BBC Micro in 1983. The game takes place within a castle in which the player must seek out the \"Golden Key of ACG\" through unlocking doors and avoiding enemies. It was Ultimate's second game to require 48K of RAM; most of their previous games for the Spectrum ran on unexpanded 16K models. Q: Are TEC-1 and Dubna 48K are based on the same processor?\n"

      "2024-02-13 22:31:02,564 - INFO - Paragraph 1: Race and the War on Drugs The War on Drugs is a term for the actions taken and legislation enacted by the United States government, intended to reduce or eliminate the production, distribution, and use of illicit drugs. The War on Drugs began during the Nixon Administration, with the goal of reducing the supply of and demand for illegal drugs, though an ulterior, racial motivation has been proposed. The War on Drugs has led to controversial legislation and policies, including mandatory minimum penalties and stop-and-frisk searches, which have been suggested to be carried out disproportionately against minorities. The effects of the War on Drugs are contentious, with some suggesting that it has created racial disparities in arrests, prosecutions, imprisonment and rehabilitation. Others have criticized the methodology and conclusions of such studies. In addition to enforcement disparities, some claim that the collateral effects of the War on Drugs have established forms of structural violence, especially for minority communities. Paragraph 2: Drug policy of Slovakia Drug policy of Slovakia is the legislative framework that governs all aspects of legal drugs and illegal drugs on the territory of Slovakia. It was established with the country's creation on 1 January 1993; the Slovak Republic taking over all commitments of the former Czechoslovakia. Both domestic and international law governs the manufacture, sale, transport and use of most drugs. Alcohol is the most used drug in Slovakia, featuring prominently in the Slovak culture. Slovakia consistently ranks among the top alcohol consuming countries in the world. Paragraph 3: Drug abuse in Tanzania Drug abuse is a major issue in Tanzania. In 2011, the drug control commission (which is dealing with drug abuse issues) reported that the number of people who are addicted ranges from 150,000 and 500,000. Most of the people who are involved in drug abuse in Tanzania are youths, who are often involved in trafficking and consuming illegal drugs like cannabis. The common illegal drugs in Tanzania are khat, marijuana, heroin, cocaine, and cannabis. Paragraph 4: Illegal drugs in Puerto Rico Illegal drugs in Puerto Rico are an increasingly significant problem from a criminal, social, and medical perspective, and a large amount of crime in Puerto Rico has been linked to the amount of illegal drugs that flow through the country. Located in the Caribbean, Puerto Rico has become a major transshipment point for drugs into the United States. Violent and property crimes have increased due in part to dealers trying to keep their drug business afloat, using guns and violence to protect themselves, their turfs, and drug habits. Paragraph 5: Illicit drug use in Australia Illicit drug use in Australia is the recreational use of prohibited drugs in Australia. Illicit drugs include illegal drugs (such as cannabis, opiates, and certain types of stimulants), pharmaceutical drugs (such as pain-killers and tranquillisers) when used for non-medical purposes, and other substances used inappropriately (such as inhalants). According to government and community organisations, the use and abuse, and the illegality, of illicit drugs is a social, health and legal issue that creates an annual illegal market estimated to be worth A$ 6.7 billion. Paragraph 6: Illegal drug trade in the Philippines The prevalence of drug use in the Philippines is lower than the global average, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). Two of the most used and valuable illegal drugs in the country are methamphetamine hydrochloride (shabu) and marijuana. Ephedrine and methylenedioxy methamphetamine are also among the list of illegal drugs that are of great concern to the authorities. Paragraph 7: Politics of drug abuse Most countries have legislation designed to criminalise some drug use. Usually however the legislative process is self-referential, defining abuse in terms of what is made illegal. The legislation concerns lists of drugs specified by the legislation. These drugs are often called \"illegal drugs\" but, generally, what is illegal is their unlicensed production, supply and possession. The drugs are also called \"controlled drugs\" or \"controlled substances\". Paragraph 8: Ephedrine Ephedrine is a medication and stimulant. It is often used to prevent low blood pressure during spinal anesthesia. It has also been used for asthma, narcolepsy, and obesity but is not the preferred treatment. It is of unclear benefit in nasal congestion. It can be taken by mouth or by injection into a muscle, vein, or just under the skin. Onset with intravenous use is fast, while injection into a muscle can take 20 minutes, and by mouth can take an hour for effect. When given by injection it lasts about an hour and when taken by mouth it can last up to four hours. Paragraph 9: Drug addiction in Pakistan Drug addiction is defined as compulsive and out-of-control drug use, despite negative consequences. In the last few decades, drug addiction has increased exponentially in Pakistan. Most of the illegal drugs come from the neighbouring Afghanistan. According to the UN estimate, 8.9 million people in the country are drug users. Cannabis is the most used drug. The rate of injection drug abuse has also increased significantly in Pakistan, sparking fears of an HIV epidemic. Paragraph 10: Drug possession Drug possession is the crime of having one or more illegal drugs in one's possession, either for personal use, distribution, sale or otherwise. Illegal drugs fall into different categories and sentences vary depending on the amount, type of drug, circumstances, and jurisdiction.

His reign was marked by aggressive military campaigns and conquest, particularly in the Norse-dominated parts of the British Isles and Ireland, where he extended his rule to the Kingdom of the Isles and Dublin. Paragraph 2: Olaf Magnusson of Norway Olaf Magnusson (1099 – 22 December 1115) was king of Norway 1103–1115. He was the son of King Magnus Barefoot and Sigrid, daughter of Saxe of Vik. Paragraph 3: Battle of Stamford Bridge The Battle of Stamford Bridge took place at the village of Stamford Bridge, East Riding of Yorkshire, in England on 25 September 1066, between an English army under King Harold Godwinson and an invading Norwegian force led by King Harald Hardrada and the English king's brother Tostig Godwinson. After a bloody battle, both Hardrada and Tostig along with most of the Norwegians were killed. Although Harold Godwinson repelled the Norwegian invaders, his army was defeated by the Normans at Hastings less than three weeks later. The battle has traditionally been presented as symbolising the end of the Viking Age, although major Scandinavian campaigns in Britain and Ireland occurred in the following decades, such as those of King Sweyn Estrithson of Denmark in 1069–1070 and King Magnus Barefoot of Norway in 1098 and 1102–1103. Paragraph 4: King Magnus' Halt railway station King Magnus' Halt, sometimes referred to as Magnus' Grave, is the terminal railway station on the Downpatrick & County Down Railway's Southern Line, located in the town of Downpatrick in County Down, Northern Ireland. It takes its name from the nearby grave of Viking King Magnus Barefoot. The grave is a Downpatrick tourist attraction that was not easily accessible prior to the arrival of the railway. It features a platform with lampposts on the East side of the line, which looks onto a field containing the barrow of King Magnus and a runestone which was placed in March 2003 to mark the 900th anniversary of his death. Paragraph 5: Radama I Radama I \"the Great\" (1793–1828) was the first Malagasy sovereign to be recognized as King of Madagascar (1810-1828) by a European state. He came to power at the age of 18 following the death of his father, King Andrianampoinimerina. Under Radama's rule and at his invitation, the first Europeans entered his central highland Kingdom of Imerina and its capital at Antananarivo. Radama encouraged these London Missionary Society envoys to establish schools to teach tradecraft and literacy to nobles and potential military and civil service recruits; they also introduced Christianity and taught literacy using the translated Bible. A wide range of political and social reforms were enacted under his rule, including an end to the international slave trade, which had historically been a key source of wealth and armaments for the Merina monarchy. Through aggressive military campaigns he successfully united two-thirds of the island under his rule. Abuse of alcohol weakened his health and he died prematurely at age 35. He was succeeded by his highest-ranking wife, Ranavalona I. Paragraph 6: Battle of Anglesey Sound The Battle of Anglesey Sound was fought in June or July 1098 on the Menai Strait (\"Anglesey Sound\"), separating the island of Anglesey from mainland Wales. The battle was fought between Magnus Barefoot, King of Norway, and the Anglo-Norman earls Hugh of Montgomery and Hugh d'Avranches, and took place as part of Magnus Barefoot's expedition into the Irish Sea, which sought to assert Norwegian rule over the Kingdom of the Isles.

It is named after the street that runs along the building (however, it is not the address of the complex), which in turned is named after the Norwegian king Magnus Barefoot. It is the main venue of Bergen International Film Festival. Paragraph 8: List of rulers of the Kingdom of the Isles The Kingdom of the Isles comprised the Hebrides, the islands of the Firth of Clyde and the Isle of Man from the 9th to the 13th centuries AD. The islands were known to the Norse as the \"Suðreyjar\", or \"Southern Isles\" as distinct from the \"Norðreyjar\" or Northern Isles of Orkney and Shetland. The historical record is incomplete and the kingdom was probably not a continuous entity throughout the entire period. The islands concerned are sometimes referred to as the \"Kingdom of Mann and the Isles\", although only some of the later rulers claimed that title. At times the rulers were independent of external control, although for much of the period they had overlords in Norway, Ireland, England, Scotland or Orkney. At times there also appear to have been competing claims for all or parts of the territory. The islands involved have a total land area of over 8300 km2 and extend for more than 500 km from north to south.

Paragraph 10: Norman invasion of Wales The Norman invasion of Wales began shortly after the Norman conquest of England under William the Conqueror, who believed England to be his birthright. Initially (1067–1081), the invasion of Wales was not undertaken with the fervor and purpose of the invasion of England. However, a much stronger Norman invasion began in 1081 and by 1094 most of Wales was under the control of William's eldest son, King William II of England. The Welsh greatly disliked the \"gratuitously cruel\" Normans and by 1101 had regained control of the greater part of their country under the long reign of King Gruffudd ap Cynan, who had been imprisoned by the Normans for twelve years before his escape. Gruffudd had some indirect help from King Magnus III of Norway (Magnus Barefoot) who attacked the Normans briefly off the Isle of Anglesey in northwest Wales near Ynys Seiriol, killing Hugh of Montgomery, 2nd Earl of Shrewsbury and leaving the Normans depleted and demoralized. Magnus went on to take the Orkney Islands, the Hebrides, and the Isle of Man, islands north of Wales and west and north of Scotland and England, in 1098. Q: King of Norway Magnus Barefoot launched aggressive military campaigns in this region that was at times independent of external control and was known to the Norse as what?\n"

      "2024-02-13 22:31:07,311 - INFO - Paragraph 1: Bernard's wolf Bernard's wolf (\"Canis lupus bernardi\"), also known as the Banks Island tundra wolf, Banks Island wolf, and the Victoria's Island wolf, was a subspecies of the gray wolf, \"Canis lupus\", that was limited to the Banks and Victoria Island of the Canadian arctic. An extinct subspecies, it was described as \"white with black-tipped hair along the ridge of the back\". It was formally discovered, classified, and named after Peter Bernard and Joseph F. Bernard, his nephew, after an adult male skin and skull was collected by them and brought to the National Museum of Canada. There were very few specimens of this subspecies that were recovered, around three or four in total. A survey was conducted in March 1993 by the Department of Renewable Resources that was to catalog the wolf and caribou populations of the area. While a number of caribou were found and recorded, along with many other indigenous animal species, not a single wolf was found. The Victoria's Island population is believed to have died out in between 1918 and 1952. They were previously widespread in their native habitat but were annihilated by excessive hunting. Paragraph 2: Merriam's elk The Merriam's elk (\"Cervus canadensis merriami\") is an extinct subspecies of elk once found in the arid lands of the southwestern United States, predominantly Arizona. Since the arrival of the Europeans uncontrolled hunting and cattle grazing had driven the subspecies into extinction around the beginning of the 20th century, with the exact presumed date being 1906. Another subspecies of elk, the eastern elk (\"Cervus canadensis canadensis\") also became extinct at roughly the same time. Not much else is known about this subspecies as it became extinct before studies were done. Elk from Yellowstone National Park were introduced to this area in 1913, and are reasonably common in the area today. Paragraph 3: Rhinoceros sondaicus annamiticus Rhinoceros sondaicus annamiticus is an extinct subspecies of \"Rhinoceros sondaicus\", that lived in Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand and Malaysia. The term Annamiticus derives from the Annamite name of the Indochinese Mountains in Indochina, part of the distribution of this species, also known as the Javanese Javan rhinoceros or simply Vietnamese rhinoceros for Vietnam. Only this species, the Stieng called them Pai-mhai once lived across South China, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Malaysia. The subspecific annamiticus is derived from the Annamite Mountain Range in Southeast Asia, part of this subspecies' range. In 2006, a single population, estimated at fewer than 12 remaining rhinos, lived in an area of lowland forest in the Cat Tien National Park in Vietnam. Genetic analysis suggested this subspecies and the Indonesian Javan rhinoceros last shared a common ancestor between 300,000 and 2 million years ago. The last individual of this population was shot by a poacher in 2010. Paragraph 4: Portable art Portable art (sometimes called mobiliary art) refers to the small examples of Prehistoric art that could be carried from place to place, which is especially characteristic of the Art of the Upper Palaeolithic. It is one of the two main categories of Prehistoric art, the other being the immobile Parietal art, effectively synonymous with rock art. Paragraph 5: List of recently extinct plants As of September 2016, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists 116 extinct species, 132 possibly extinct species, 35 extinct in the wild species, 13 possibly extinct in the wild species, five extinct subspecies, one extinct in the wild subspecies, and four extinct varieties of plant. Paragraph 6: Prehistoric art in Scotland Prehistoric art in Scotland is visual art created or found within the modern borders of Scotland, before the departure of the Romans from southern and central Britain in the early fifth century CE, which is usually seen as the beginning of the early historic or Medieval era. There is no clear definition of prehistoric art among scholars and objects that may involve creativity often lack a context that would allow them to be understood. Paragraph 7: List of recently extinct molluscs As of September 2016, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists 310 extinct species, 117 possibly extinct species, 14 extinct in the wild species, eight extinct subspecies, and five extinct in the wild subspecies of mollusc. Paragraph 8: Trogloxene Trogloxenes, also called cave guests, are animal species which live close to caves or at the very entrance of the cave, but cannot live exclusively in a cave. This group consists of both extant animals, such as raccoons, rats, foxes and bears, opiliones (a.k.a. Daddy-Long-Legs) and extinct animals like cave bears, cave lions, cave leopards, and cave hyenas. Indications trusted by geologists and archaeologists combine to show that these animals lived there in the latter part, at least, of the third interglacial epoch, and on through the fourth and last glacial advance, when, although central Europe was free from an ice cap, an almost Arctic climate prevailed, with much rain. This is what is known as the Upper Paleolithic, when humanity in Europe was represented by the Neanderthals. Paragraph 9: List of recently extinct invertebrates As of July 2016, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists 394 extinct species, 206 possibly extinct species, 16 extinct in the wild species, eight extinct subspecies, and five extinct in the wild subspecies of invertebrate. Paragraph 10: Panthera leo spelaea Panthera leo spelaea or P. spelaea, commonly known as the European or Eurasian cave lion, is an extinct subspecies of lion. It is known from fossils and many examples of prehistoric art. Q:  What species has an extinct subspecies that are classified as Trogloxene and are known from fossils and prehistoric art?\n"

Paragraph 8: Lloydieae The Lloydieae were a tribe of monocotyledon perennial, herbaceous mainly bulbous flowering plants in the Liliaceae (Lily) family. The tribe was generally considered monogeric, being represented by the single genus \"Lloydia\". But since that genus has at various times and is now considered to be part of the genus \"Gagea\", and therefore in the \"Lilieae\" tribe, it was sometimes listed with both genera. Furthermore many authorities place \"Gagea\" into a separate tribe, Tulipeae. It has also historically been considered to be a subtribe of the Lilieae. In 2013, Kim \"et al.\" proposed splitting off \"Gagea\" from the rest of Tulipeae by resurrecting the tribe Lloydieae.

During his long career in the young American Navy he served under six presidents beginning with John Adams and is notable for his many victories at sea. He commanded several famous naval ships, including  and saw service in the Barbary Wars and the War of 1812. Bainbridge was also in command of USS \"Philadelphia\" when she grounded off the shores of Tripoli in North Africa, resulting in his capture and imprisonment for many months. In the latter part of his career he became the U.S. Naval Commissioner. Paragraph 2: USS Bainbridge (CGN-25) USS \"Bainbridge\" (DLGN-25/CGN-25) was a nuclear-powered guided missile cruiser in the United States Navy, the only ship of her class. Named in honor of Commodore William Bainbridge, she was the fourth US Navy ship to bear the name. With her original hull classification symbol of DLGN (nuclear-powered guided missile destroyer leader, called a \"frigate\" at the time), she was the first nuclear-powered destroyer-type ship in the US Navy, and shared her name with the lead ship of the first US Navy destroyer class, the \"Bainbridge\"-class destroyer s. Paragraph 3: Bainbridge County, Mississippi Bainbridge County, Mississippi, was formed by an act of the Mississippi General Assembly dated January 17, 1823 from the western two-thirds of the original Covington County, Mississippi. Its area was almost identical to the modern limits of Covington County, the eastern third of the original county being cut off to form Jones County, Mississippi in 1826, leaving the area of former Bainbridge County as Covington County. The land had been settled from 1811 on by families from the southeastern United States, including a number of free people of color. A state census, \"An account of the increase and decrease of the population of the State of Mississippi in the County of Bainbridge for the year 1823,\" was taken in its first year of existence, but the county was dissolved by an act dated January 21, 1824 and its land returned to Covington County. No reason for its dissolution has been discovered. Though the reason the county was named Bainbridge was not recorded in the creating act, in keeping with naming traditions of that time and place, it was likely named to honor notable U.S. Navy Commodore William Bainbridge. Paragraph 4: USS Bainbridge (DD-246) The third USS \"Bainbridge\" (DD-246) was a \"Clemson\"-class destroyer in the United States Navy during World War II.

She is the fifth ship to carry that name, and the 46th destroyer of a planned 75-ship class. \"Bainbridge\" is named in honor of Commodore William Bainbridge, who as commander of the frigate USS \"Constitution\" distinguished himself in the War of 1812 when he and his crew captured HMS \"Java\", a 38-gun fifth-rate frigate of the Royal Navy. Paragraph 7: John Adams John Adams (October 30 [O.S. October 19] 1735 – July 4, 1826) was an American patriot who served as the second President of the United States (1797–1801) and the first Vice President (1789–97).

Bainbridge played cricket principally for Eton, MCC, Surrey, Cambridge University and Warwickshire. He was born at Guwahati, Assam, India and died at Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, England. Paragraph 9: Fort Bainbridge Fort Bainbridge, believed to be named in honor of naval captain William Bainbridge, was a military supply fort located along the Federal Road on what is today the county line between Macon and Russell counties in Alabama. It was either constructed in late 1813 or early 1814 by Georgia troops under the command of Colonel Homer V. Milton or General John B.

Paragraph 10: Jacob Dolson Cox Jacob Dolson Cox, (Jr.) (October 27, 1828August 4, 1900) was a statesman, lawyer, Union Army general during the American Civil War, and later a Republican politician from Ohio. He served as the 28th Governor of Ohio and as United States Secretary of the Interior. As Governor of Ohio, Cox sided for a time with President Andrew Johnson's Reconstruction plan and was against African American suffrage in the South, though he supported it in Ohio. Seeing himself caught between Johnson and the Radical Republicans, Cox decided not to run for reelection. He stayed out of politics for a year, though both Sherman and Grant advocated that Cox replace Stanton as Secretary of War as a means of stemming the demands for Johnson's impeachment. But Johnson declined. When Ulysses S. Grant became President he nominated Cox Secretary of Interior and Cox immediately accepted. Secretary of Interior Cox implemented the first civil service reform in a federal government department, including examinations for most clerks. Grant initially supported Cox and civil service reform, creating America's first Civil Service Commission. However, Cox was opposed by Republican Party managers, who ultimately convinced Grant to cease civil service reforms. President Grant and Secretary Cox were at odds over the fraudulent McGarahan Claims and the Dominican Republic annexation treaty. Secretary Cox advocated a lasting, honest, and comprehensive Indian policy legislated by Congress after the Piegan Indian massacre. Cox resigned as Secretary of Interior having been unable to gain Grant's support over civil service reform. Although Cox was a reformer, Grant had believed Cox had overstepped his authority as Secretary of Interior and had undermined his authority as President. In 1872 Cox joined the Liberal Republicans in opposition to Grant's renomination. In 1876 Cox returned to politics and was elected to and served one term as United States Congressman of Ohio. Congressman Cox supported President Hayes's reform efforts, but his term as Congressman was unsuccessful at establishing permanent Civil Service reform. Cox retired and did not return to active politics, using his time to write several books on Civil War campaigns which remain today respected histories and memoirs. Q: From what state was the congressman who became Secretary of Defense and reportedly refused to promote Les Brownlee to Secretary of the Army because he was not a CEO?\n"

      "2024-02-13 22:31:26,964 - INFO - Paragraph 1: Karma (novel) Karma is a 2014 novel written by Karanam Pavan Prasad. Karma is a contemporary novel dealing with inner conflicts such as identity, faith with respect to the ritual orthodoxy and customs of the society. The novel thoroughly narrated the difference between Faith and Belief in such a way that each and every character, including the protagonist of the novel get penetrated by that derivation. Details documented about the Hindu death rituals within the story-line are absolute novel writing technique adopted by the writer. The Novel got an immense response from the literature world. Within the year of its release Novel went on with third edition and reached worldwide Kannada readers. Paragraph 2: Lieben lassen Lieben lassen is the erotic romance novel from authors Ariane Sommer and Roman Libbertz. Published in September 2015 it is notable for its explicit erotic scenes and unusual writing technique. The story's narration alternates between the perspectives of the male and the female protagonists. Paragraph 3: Les Champs magnétiques \" Les Champs magnétiques \" \"(The Magnetic Fields)\" is a book by André Breton and Philippe Soupault. It is famed as the first work of literary Surrealism. Published in 1920, the authors used a surrealist automatic writing technique. Paragraph 4: Bob Ong Bob Ong is the pseudonym of a contemporary Filipino author known for using conversational writing technique to create humorous and reflective depictions of Philippine life. The author's actual name and identity is unknown. Paragraph 5: Allison Gross Allison Gross, a hideous witch, tries to bribe the narrator to be her \"leman\". She combed his hair, first. When a scarlet mantle, a silk shirt with pearls, and a golden cup all fail, she blows on a horn three times, making an oath to make him regret it; then she strikes him with a silver wand, turning him into a wyrm (dragon) bound to a tree. His sister Maisry came to him to comb his hair. One day the Seelie Court came by, and a queen stroked him three times, turning him back into his proper form. Paragraph 6: Tybalt Tybalt is the main antagonist in William Shakespeare's play \"Romeo and Juliet\". He is the son of Lady Capulet's brother, Juliet's short-tempered first cousin, and Romeo's rival. Tybalt shares the same name as the character Tibert/Tybalt the \"Prince of Cats\" in \"Reynard the Fox\", a point of mockery in the play. Mercutio repeatedly calls Tybalt \"Prince of Cats\" (perhaps referring not only to Reynard but to the Italian word cazzo as well). Luigi da Porto adapted the story as \"Giulietta e Romeo\" and included it in his \"Historia novellamente ritrovata di due Nobili Amanti\" published in 1530. Da Porto drew on \"Pyramus and Thisbe\" and Giovanni Boccaccio's \"Decameron\". He gave it much of its modern form, including the lovers' names, the rival families of Montecchi and Capuleti, and the location in Verona. He also introduces characters corresponding to Shakespeare's Mercutio, Tybalt, and Paris. Da Porto presents his tale as historically true and claims it took place in the days of Bartolomeo II della Scala (a century earlier than Salernitano). Montague and Capulet were actual 13th-century political factions, but the only connection between them is a mention in Dante's\" Purgatorio\" as an example of civil dissension. Paragraph 7: Rule of three (writing) The rule of three is a writing principle that suggests that events or characters introduced in threes are more humorous, satisfying, or effective in execution of the story and engaging the reader. The reader or audience of this form of text is also thereby more likely to remember the information conveyed. This is because having three entities combines both brevity and rhythm with having the smallest amount of information to create a pattern. It makes the author or speaker appear knowledgeable while being both simple and catchy. Paragraph 8: Article spinning Article spinning is a specific writing technique used in search engine optimization (SEO) and in other applications. Website authors may use article spinning on their own sites to reduce the similarity ratio of rather redundant pages or pages with thin content. Content spinning works by rewriting existing articles, or parts of articles, and replacing specific words, phrases, sentences, or even entire paragraphs with any number of alternate versions to provide a slightly different variation with each spin. This process can be completely automated or written manually. Paragraph 9: Arrow (season 2) The second season of the American television series \"Arrow\" premiered on The CW on October 10, 2013 and concluded on May 14, 2014 with a total of 23 episodes. The series is based on the DC Comics character Green Arrow, a costumed crime-fighter created by Mort Weisinger and George Papp. The showrunners for this season were Greg Berlanti, Marc Guggenheim and Andrew Kreisberg. This season introduces characters from \"The Flash\", which was being developed as a potential spin-off at the time. Paragraph 10: Show, don't tell Show, don't tell is a technique often employed in various kinds of texts to enable the reader to experience the story through action, words, thoughts, senses, and feelings rather than through the author's exposition, summarization, and description. The goal is not to drown the reader in heavy-handed adjectives, but rather to allow readers to interpret significant details in the text. The technique applies equally to nonfiction and all forms of fiction, literature including Haiku and Imagism poetry in particular, speech, movie making, and playwriting. Q: Allison Gross is a character in a story which applies what writing technique that introduces characters in threes? \n"

It takes its name from the large number of granite columns that were found on the site and probably once formed part of the ancient agora. The Byzantine castle is believed to have been built at the end of the 7th century AD to protect the port and the city of Nea Pafos from Arab raids and later remodeled by the Lusignans. The Fortress had a three-metre thick wall with four huge corner towers and another four intermediary towers along the joining walls and moat surrounding the castle. Access was across a wooden bridge spanning the moat. The square courtyard measured 35 metres long by 35 metres wide, with a tower at each corner. The main entrance was through a fifth, horseshoe-shaped tower on the east side. Destroyed by an earthquake in 1222, the castle was subsequently abandoned. Paragraph 2: Prizren Fortress Prizren Fortress (Serbian: Призренски град\"/Prizrenski grad\" ), also known as Kaljaja (Albanian: \"Каlаја\" , ) and Dušan's Fortress (Душанов град\"/Dušanov grad\" ), is a medieval fortress in Prizren, Kosovo, which once served as the capital of the Serbian Empire. It was built on a hill above Prizrenska Bistrica, around which the modern city developed.

Paragraph 4: Fortress of Klis The Klis Fortress (Croatian: \"Tvrđava Klis\" ) is a medieval fortress situated above a village bearing the same name, near the city of Split, in central Dalmatia, Croatia. From its origin as a small stronghold built by the ancient Illyrian tribe Dalmatae, becoming a royal castle that was the seat of many Croatian kings, to its final development as a large fortress during the Ottoman wars in Europe, Klis Fortress has guarded the frontier, being lost and re-conquered several times throughout its more-than-two-thousand-year-long history. Due to its location on a pass that separates the mountains Mosor and Kozjak, the fortress served as a major source of defense in Dalmatia, especially against the Ottoman advance, and has been a key crossroad between the Mediterranean belt and the Balkan rear. Paragraph 5: Yellowcraigs Yellowcraig, less commonly known as Broad Sands Bay, is a coastal area of forest, beach and grassland in East Lothian, south-east Scotland.

Paragraph 2: Runge–Kutta–Fehlberg method In mathematics, the Runge–Kutta–Fehlberg method (or Fehlberg method) is an algorithm in numerical analysis for the numerical solution of ordinary differential equations. It was developed by the German mathematician Erwin Fehlberg and is based on the large class of Runge–Kutta methods. Paragraph 3: Trefftz method In mathematics, the Trefftz method is a method for the numerical solution of partial differential equations named after the German mathematician Erich Trefftz (1888–1937). It falls within the class of finite element methods. Paragraph 4: Wolfgang Hackbusch Wolfgang Hackbusch (born 24 October 1948 in Westerstede, Lower Saxony) is a German mathematician, known for his pioneering research in multigrid methods and later hierarchical matrices, a concept generalizing the fast multipole method. He was a professor at the University of Kiel and is currently one of the directors of the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences in Leipzig. Paragraph 5: Martin Wilhelm Kutta Martin Wilhelm Kutta (] ; 3 November 1867 – 25 December 1944) was a German mathematician. Paragraph 6: Runge–Kutta methods In numerical analysis, the Runge–Kutta methods are a family of implicit and explicit iterative methods, which include the well-known routine called the Euler Method, used in temporal discretization for the approximate solutions of ordinary differential equations. These methods were developed around 1900 by the German mathematicians C. Runge and M. W. Kutta. Paragraph 7: Kutta condition The Kutta condition is a principle in steady-flow fluid dynamics, especially aerodynamics, that is applicable to solid bodies with sharp corners, such as the trailing edges of airfoils. It is named for German mathematician and aerodynamicist Martin Wilhelm Kutta. Paragraph 8: Kutta–Joukowski theorem The Kutta–Joukowski theorem is a fundamental theorem of aerodynamics used for the calculation of the lift of an airfoil and any two-dimensional bodies including circular cylinders translating in a uniform fluid at a constant speed large enough so that the flow seen in the body-fixed frame is steady and unseparated. The theorem relates the lift generated by an airfoil to the speed of the airfoil through the fluid, the density of the fluid and the circulation around the airfoil. The circulation is defined as the line integral around a closed loop enclosing the airfoil of the component of the velocity of the fluid tangent to the loop. It is named after the German Martin Wilhelm Kutta and the Russian Nikolai Zhukovsky (or Joukowski) who first developed its key ideas in the early 20th century. Kutta–Joukowski theorem is an inviscid theory, but it is a good approximation for real viscous flow in typical aerodynamic applications.

      "2024-02-13 22:31:31,659 - INFO - Paragraph 1: Sweet Crude Sweet Crude is a documentary film by Sandy Cioffi about Nigeria's oil-rich Niger Delta. The film premiered in April 2009 at the Full Frame Documentary Film Festival and has since screened at 30 film festivals around the world and has won numerous awards. Paragraph 2: Sandy Cioffi Sandy Cioffi is a Seattle-based film and video artist. She is director and producer of the documentary film Sweet Crude and has produced and/or directed the films Crocodile Tears, Terminal 187 and Just Us. She is a tenured professor in the Film and Video Communications Department at Seattle Central Community College. Paragraph 3: Pennsylvania Grade Crude Oil Pennsylvania Grade Crude Oil is a type of sweet crude oil (sweet crude oil), found primarily in the Appalachian basin in the Marcellus Formation in the states of New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia, and takes its name for the state of Pennsylvania, where it was first extracted in 1859 from the Drake Well. The area's Pennsylvania Grade Crude Oil has superior qualities and is free of asphaltic constituents, contains only trace amounts of sulfur and nitrogen, and has excellent characteristics for refining into lubricants. The success of drilling for oil at this well led to \"an international search for petroleum, and in many ways eventually changed the way we live.\" There is archaeological evidence that Native Americans harvested \"the oil for medicinal purposes by digging small pits around active seeps and lining them with wood\" at least as far back as 1410 AD. European settlers skimmed the \"oil from the seeps and using the petroleum as a source of lamp fuel and machinery lubrication.\" Paragraph 4: Desert Victory Desert Victory is a 1943 film produced by the British Ministry of Information, documenting the Allies' North African campaign against Field Marshal Erwin Rommel and the Afrika Korps. This documentary traces the struggle between General Erwin Rommel and Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery, from the German's defeat at El Alamein to Tripoli. The film was produced by David MacDonald and directed by Roy Boulting who also directed Tunisian Victory and \"Burma Victory\". Like the famous \"Why We Fight\" series of films by Frank Capra, \"Desert Victory\" relies heavily on captured German newsreel footage. Many of the most famous sequences in the film have been excerpted and appear with frequency in History Channel and A&E productions. The film won a special Academy Award in 1943 and the 1951 film \"\" took sections of the film for its battle footage. Paragraph 5: United States Oil Fund The United States Oil Fund (NYSE Arca: [ USO] ) is an exchange-traded fund that attempts to track the price of West Texas Intermediate Light Sweet Crude Oil. Paragraph 6: Tunisian Victory Tunisian Victory is a 1944 Anglo-American propaganda film about the victories in the North Africa Campaign. Paragraph 7: Oil reserves in Libya Oil reserves in Libya are the largest in Africa and among the ten largest globally with 46.4 Goilbbl as of 2010. Oil production was 1.65 Moilbbl/d as of 2010, giving Libya 77 years of reserves at current production rates if no new reserves were to be found. Libya is considered a highly attractive oil area due to its low cost of oil production (as low as $1 per barrel at some fields in 2002), low sulfur content, being classified as \"sweet crude\" and in its proximity to European markets. Libya's challenge is maintaining production at mature fields, while finding and developing new oil fields. Most of Libya remains under-explored as a result of past sanctions and disagreements with foreign oil companies. Paragraph 8: Gold Coast (region) The Gold Coast is the gold rich region that is now the nation of Ghana on the petroleum sweet crude oil and natural gas rich Gulf of Guinea in West Africa, Africa. Paragraph 9: Sweet crude oil Sweet crude oil is a type of petroleum. The New York Mercantile Exchange designates petroleum with less than 0.42% sulfur as \"sweet\". Petroleum containing higher levels of sulfur is called sour crude oil. Paragraph 10: Enbridge Line 5 Enbridge Line 5 is a major oil pipeline in the Enbridge Lakehead System, which conveys petroleum from western Canada to eastern Canada via the Great Lakes states. Line 5 is particularly notable for passing under the environmentally sensitive Straits of Mackinac, which connect Lake Michigan to Lake Huron. As of December 2013, it is capable of carrying 540,000 oilbbl of oil per day. It carries synthetic crude, natural gas liquids, sweet crude, and light sour crude.

Paragraph 5: Two Airlines Policy The Australian Two Airlines Policy (or Two Airlines Agreement) was a policy of Australian Federal Governments from the late 1940s to the 1990s. Under the policy, only two airlines were allowed to operate flights between state capital city and major regional city airports. For most of the period of the policy, the \"two airlines\" were the privately owned Ansett Airlines and the government-owned Trans Australia Airlines. Though persisting for some decades, the policy finally fell into abeyance in the world-wide airline deregulations of the 1990s. Paragraph 6: Chinese in Samoa The majority of Chinese nationals currently residing in Samoa are businessmen, labour workers and shopowners in the south western island nation of Samoa, and there are at least 30,000 people in Samoa who are of mixed Samoan and Chinese descent, although they are classified as ethnic Samoans in official census.

      "2024-02-13 22:31:33,829 - INFO - Paragraph 1: Trekking pole Trekking poles (also known as hiking poles, hiking sticks or walking poles) are a common hiking accessory used to assist walkers with their rhythm and provide stability on rough terrain. Paragraph 2: Holdout (gambling) In gambling jargon, a holdout is any of numerous accessories used by cheats to help them \"hold-out\" a card (or cards) during a card game. Some holdout devices are extremely simple and require moderate or advanced manipulative skill to be used properly. On the other hand, there is a group of holdout devices which are mechanical in nature, therefore they fall under a separate category of holdout machines. Even if those machines are complex mechanical apparatuses, they still require a good level of skill from the cheat's part, to be used well. Paragraph 3: Bench dog A bench dog is an accessory used on a woodworking workbench to allow clamping of wooden items while being worked or planed. Dog in general is something which holds. At its most basic a bench dog is simply a peg which is installed in a corresponding \"dog hole\" in the top of a bench. The holes are arranged in a line perpendicular to the vise, perhaps three or four inches apart but certainly no further apart than the fully open distance between the vise's jaws. Paragraph 4: Hold fast A hold fast is an accessory used on a woodworking workbench and in blacksmithing to fix a workpiece to the top or side of the bench while it is being worked. Paragraph 5: Cocktail strainer A cocktail strainer is a metal bar accessory used to remove ice from a mixed drink as it is poured into the serving glass. A type of sieve, the strainer is placed over the mouth of the glass or shaker in which the beverage was prepared; small holes in the device allow only liquids to pass as the beverage is poured. Paragraph 6: Bench hook A bench hook is a workbench accessory used in woodworking, and its purpose is to provide a stop against which the piece of wood being worked can be firmly held, without having to use the vice, thus saving time. It makes handsawing safer and more accurate. This simple appliance (three sticks of wood) uses the force of the tool and gravity to hold the workpiece and helps guide the tool blade to keep the cuts right on the line. It also allows one to perform with ease (and safety) those cuts that would be terrifying on a power saw and which should be carefully avoided. The bench hook is simply a short wooden board with a batten fixed along the top edge (the stop), with another one—called the hook—astened underneath the bottom at the opposite end (see diagram to the right). The correct practice is to have the stop shorter than the width of base and offset from one edge, thus allowing the saw to complete the cut without scarring the workbench surface. Left handers are obviously obliged to set the stop in reverse. In use the bench hook is laid flat over the bench, with the hook hard up against the front edge of same. With the workpiece thus firmly held against the stop, is easy to see that no clamps or other mechanical fixing are required, the wood being held in place by the combined pressure of the tool (a saw generally) and the hand. Bench hooks are meant to be an aid commonly used with hand tools, such as the backsaw, a hand plane and, somewhat less frequently, a chisel of some kind. Although very simple to make, commercially made bench hooks have become increasingly available. Paragraph 7: Cheating Cheating is the receiving of a reward for ability or finding an easy way out of an unpleasant situation by dishonest means. It is generally used for the breaking of rules to gain unfair advantage in a competitive situation. This broad definition will necessarily include acts of bribery, cronyism, nepotism, sleaze and any situation where individuals are given preference using inappropriate criteria. The rules infringed may be explicit, or they may be from an unwritten code of conduct based on morality, ethics or custom, making the identification of cheating conduct a potentially subjective process. Cheating can refer specifically to marital infidelity. Someone who is known for cheating is referred to as a \"cheat\" in British English, and a \"cheater\" in American English. A person described as a \"cheat\" doesn't necessarily cheat all the time, but rather, relies on unfair tactics to the point of acquiring a reputation for it. Paragraph 8: Spin disk A spin disk is an socket wrench accessory used to quickly turn nuts after they have been loosened with the wrench. Paragraph 9: Astronomical filter An astronomical filter is a telescope accessory used by amateur astronomers to simply enhance the details of celestial objects (much as with amateur photography). By contrast professional astronomers rigorously use filters on telescopes in order to understand the astrophysics (such as stellar classification and placement of a celestial body on its Wien Curve), occurring for the object in a given bandpass via photometry. Paragraph 10: Color scroller A color scroller or color changer is an electro-mechanical lighting accessory used in theater, film, dance and concerts to change the color projected by stage lighting instruments without the need of a person to be in the vicinity of the light. A color scroller moves plastic \"gel\" color gel [actually dyed polyester and/or other base materials coated with dyes] into the beam of the light. It is generally attached to the gel frame holder at the transmitting end of a lighting fixture, so color is introduced after the beam characteristics have been defined by the optics of the lighting instrument. Most scrollers are controlled via DMX512 protocol, but some models (e.g. Wybron's Coloram IT) also utilize the RDM protocol. When color scrollers were first introduced around 1980, a number of companies produced them, including: Avolites, GAM Products, Morpheus Lights, Rainbow, Rosco Laboratories and Wybron Inc. Now the main manufacturers are: A.C. Lighting, Apollo, Morpheus Lights and Rainbow (in alphabetical order). Q: A holdout is an accessory used by cheats in order for them to recieve what?\n"

Born into a wealthy family at Coleraine, County Londonderry, he was the son of Daniel Todd (1735-1783) of Randalstown, Co. Antrim, and his wife Letitia Thornton, sister of Lt.-General Sir William Thornton. He came to North America to work in the trading firm of his uncle, Isaac Todd, who was the business partner of James McGill at Montreal. He became a junior partner of the firm and in 1791 was admitted as a member of the Beaver Club. In 1794, the Spanish Governor, Francisco Luis Héctor de Carondelet, granted him an exclusive monopoly over all the trade in Louisiana; highly sought after particularly by Canadians as it was then still separate to the United States. This gave him the exclusive right to the valuable trade on the Upper Mississippi River, the Missouri River and the area north of Ohio. He jealously defended his position and soon became known in the region as \"\"Don Andreas\"\", successfully sending vast stores of goods up from New Orleans while bringing back furs. His uncle's firm back in Montreal, \"Todd, McGill & Co.,\" had found itself in a position to then monopolize the supply of the entire Mississippi Valley, but the declaration of war between Spain and Britain in October 1796, followed by Andrew’s death at New Orleans later that year, dashed their expectations. At his decease, Andrew Todd was unmarried and left no children. By his will, he released his slave, Jack, and left his entire estate to his uncle, Isaac, except for $500 that he left to James McGill, the other executor of his will. Paragraph 10: Minister of Manpower and Immigration (Canada) Minister of Manpower and Immigration was a former position in the Cabinet of Canada from 1966 to 1977.

These were precursors to amusement parks. These trolley parks were created by the streetcar companies to give people a reason to use their services on weekends. These parks originally consisted of picnic groves and pavilions, and often held events such as dances, concerts and fireworks. Many eventually added features such as swimming pools, carousels, Ferris wheels, roller coasters, sports fields, boats rides, restaurants and other resort facilities to become amusement parks. Various sources report the existence of between 1,500 and 2,000 amusement parks in the United States by 1919.

The park and its rides have won awards from organizations such as \"Amusement Today\", American Coaster Enthusiasts, and the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions. In 2014, Travel Channel rated Knoebels one of their Top 10 Family Friendly Amusement Parks in the United States. America's Number One Amusement Park Paragraph 3: Amusement park An amusement park is a park that features various attractions, such as rides and games, as well as other events for entertainment purposes. A theme park is a type of amusement park that bases its structures and attractions around a central theme, often featuring multiple areas with different themes. Unlike temporary and mobile funfairs and carnivals, amusement parks are stationary and built for long-lasting operation. They are more elaborate than city parks and playgrounds, usually providing attractions that cater to a variety of age groups. While amusement parks often contain themed areas, theme parks place a heavier focus with more intricately-designed themes that revolve around a particular subject or group of subjects.

These amusement parks were especially popular among Singaporeans as it was the locals only form of entertainment, before television or shopping malls were introduced. Gay World Park was an all-in-one complex, where visitors were offered a wide range of entertainment, from movies to shopping and games.

They usually cater to \"sub-regional markets of larger metropolitan areas.\" FECs are generally small compared to full-scale amusement parks, with fewer attractions, a lower per-person per-hour cost to consumers than a traditional amusement park, and not usually major tourist attractions, but sustained by an area customer base. Many are locally owned and operated, although there are a number of chains and franchises in the field. FECs are sometimes called family amusement centers, play zones, family fun centers, or simply fun centers. Some non-traditional FECs, called urban entertainment centers (UECs), with more customized and branded attractions and retail outlets, are associated with major entertainment companies and may be tourist destinations. Others, sometimes operated by Non-Profit organizations as Children's Museums or Science Centers, tend to be geared toward edutainment experiences rather than simply amusement. FECs may also be adjuncts to full-scale amusement parks. Q: Which is a French documentary, The Seine Meets Paris and Great Old Amusement Parks?\n"

Utah\" (1879), the \"Trade-Mark Cases\" (1879), \"Strauder v. West Virginia\" (1880), \"Pace v. Alabama\" (1883), \"United States v. Harris\" (1883), \"Ex parte Crow Dog\" (1883), \"Hurtado v. California\" (1884), \"Clawson v. United States\" (1885), \"Yick Wo v. Hopkins\" (1886), \"United States v. Kagama\" (1886), \"Ker v. Illinois\" (1886), and \"Mugler v. Kansas\" (1887). Paragraph 3: Legal Tender Cases The Legal Tender Cases were a series of United States Supreme Court cases in the latter part of the nineteenth century that affirmed the constitutionality of paper money. In the 1869 case of \"Hepburn v. Griswold\", the Court had held that declaring paper notes to be legal tender in payment of debts existing prior to the Legal Tender Act of 1862 violated the United States Constitution. In the \"Legal Tender Cases\", the Court overruled \"Hepburn\", beginning with \"Knox v. Lee\" and \"Parker v. Davis\" in 1871, and then \"Juilliard v. Greenman\" in 1884. Paragraph 4: Hollingsworth v. Perry Hollingsworth v. Perry refers to a series of United States federal court cases that legalized same-sex marriage in the State of California. The case began in 2009 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, which found that banning same-sex marriage violates equal protection under the law. This decision overturned ballot initiative Proposition 8, which had banned same-sex marriage. After the State of California refused to defend Proposition 8, the official sponsors of Proposition 8 intervened and appealed to the Supreme Court. The case was litigated during the governorships of both Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jerry Brown, and was thus known as Perry v. Schwarzenegger and Perry v. Brown, respectively. As \"Hollingsworth v. Perry\", it eventually reached the United States Supreme Court, which held that, in line with prior precedent, the official sponsors of a ballot initiative measure did not have Article III standing to appeal an adverse federal court ruling when the state refused to do so. Paragraph 5: Stephen Halbrook Stephen P. Halbrook is a Senior Fellow at the Independent Institute and an author and lawyer known for his litigation on behalf of the National Rifle Association. He has written extensively about the original meanings of the Second Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment (the latter as applied to Second Amendment rights). He has argued and won three cases before the US Supreme Court: \"Printz v. United States\", \"United States v. Thompson-Center Arms Company\", and \"Castillo v. United States\". He has also written briefs in many other cases, including the Supreme Court cases \"Small v. United States\" (pertaining to the Gun Control Act of 1968) and \"McDonald v. Chicago\". In \"District of Columbia v. Heller\", he wrote a brief on behalf of the majority of both houses of Congress. More broadly, his decades of research on the Second Amendment contributed to the intellectual foundation of the \"Heller\" decision. He has written many books and articles on the topic of gun control, some of which have been cited in Supreme Court opinions (\"Heller\", \"McDonald\", \"Printz v. United States\"). He has testified before congress on multiple occasions. Halbrook’s most important scholarly contribution, however, was the book \"That Every Man Be Armed\", originally published in 1986. The book was the most thorough analysis of the legal history and original intent of the Second Amendment. Paragraph 6: Arizona v. United States Arizona v. United States, 567 U.S. ___ (2012) , was a United States Supreme Court case involving Arizona's S.B. 1070, a state law intended to increase the powers of local law enforcement who wished to enforce federal immigration laws. At issue is whether the law usurps the federal government's authority to regulate immigration laws and enforcement. The Court ruled that sections 3, 5(C), and 6 of S. B. 1070 were preempted by federal law, but left other parts of the law intact, including a provision that allowed law enforcement to investigate a person's immigration status. Paragraph 7: List of United States state supreme court cases Every year, each of the 50 United States state supreme courts decides hundreds of cases. Of those cases dealing with state law, a few significantly shape or re-shape the law of their state or are so influential that they later become models for decisions of other states or the federal government, or are noted for being rejected by other jurisdictions. The same is true of those cases involving a federal question, except that these may be appealed to the United States Supreme Court. This list contains notable final decisions of these courts – those that were not subject to appeal, or from which no appeal was taken, or from which an appeal was taken but certiorari was denied. Appealed decisions that are notable primarily because of later actions of the U.S. Supreme Court covered in the listings of U.S. Supreme Court cases. The decisions are listed in chronological order. Paragraph 8: Arizona v. California Arizona v. California is a set of United States Supreme Court cases, all dealing with disputes over water distribution from the Colorado River between the states of Arizona and California. It also covers the amount of water that the State of Nevada receives from the river as well. Paragraph 9: Reynolds v. United States Reynolds v. United States, 98 U.S. (8 Otto.) 145 (1878), was a Supreme Court of the United States case that held that religious duty was not a defense to a criminal indictment. \"Reynolds\" was the first Supreme Court opinion to address the Impartial Jury and the Confrontation Clauses of the Sixth Amendment. Paragraph 10: Evans v. Jordan Evans v. Jordan, 13 U.S. 199 (1815) , was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that someone who had copied a patented invention after the patent had expired, and before the patent was restored by a private bill, would be liable for damages for patent infringement for any use continuing after the patent was restored. It was the second published Supreme Court decision on patent law, and the first of four Supreme Court cases dealing with the Oliver Evans flour mill patent. Like other Supreme Court patent cases prior to \"Evans v. Eaton\", however, this case did not deal with substantive patent law, but only with issues of statutory construction and infringement liability. Q: Are both Arizona v. United States and Reynolds v. United States Supreme Court cases?\n"

      "2024-02-13 22:31:48,202 - INFO - Paragraph 1: Battle of Arausio The Battle of Arausio took place on 6 October 105 BC, at a site between the town of Arausio (modern day Orange, Vaucluse) and the Rhône River. Ranged against the migratory tribes of the Cimbri under Boiorix and the Teutoni were two Roman armies, commanded by the proconsul Quintus Servilius Caepio and consul Gnaeus Mallius Maximus. However, bitter differences between the commanders prevented the Roman armies from cooperating, with devastating results. The terrible defeat gave Gaius Marius the opportunity to come to the fore and radically reform the organization and recruitment of Roman legions. Roman losses are described as being up to 80,000 troops, as well as another 40,000 auxiliary troops (allies) and servants and camp followers — virtually all of their participants in the battle. In numbers of losses, this battle is regarded as the worst defeat in the history of ancient Rome. Paragraph 2: Battle of Tara (Ireland) The Battle of Tara was fought between the Gaelic Irish of Meath, led by Máel Sechnaill mac Domnaill, and the Norse Vikings of Dublin, led by Amlaíb Cuarán. It took place near the Hill of Tara in Ireland in the year 980. The battle was a devastating defeat for the Vikings and led to the Irish regaining control of Dublin. Paragraph 3: Battle of Byeokjegwan The Battle of Byeokjegwan (or Pyŏkje) (Chinese: 碧蹄館大戰; \"Bì tí guǎn dàzhàn\") was a battle fought on January 27, 1593 (January 26 according to the Japanese calendar of the time), between the armies of the Ming Dynasty led by Li Rusong, and the Japanese forces under Tachibana Muneshige, Ukita Hideie, and Kobayakawa Takakage. As part of the Japanese Invasion of Korea (Imjin War), it was the first field battle fought during the war between the two sides. Paragraph 4: Max Hoffmann Carl Adolf Maximilian Hoffmann (25 January 1869 – 8 July 1927) was a German military strategist. As a staff officer at the beginning of World War I, he was Chief of Staff of the 8th Army. Hoffmann, along with Hindenburg and Ludendorff, masterminded the devastating defeat of the Russian armies at Tannenberg and the Masurian Lakes. He then held the position of Chief of Staff of the Eastern Front. At the end of 1917, he negotiated with Russia to sign the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. In 1922, he tried to set up an anti-Soviet coalition without success. Paragraph 5: Battle of Svensksund The Battle of Svensksund (Finnish: \"Ruotsinsalmi\", Russian: \"Rochensalm\") was a naval battle fought in the Gulf of Finland outside the present day city of Kotka on 9 and 10 July 1790. The Swedish naval forces dealt the Russian fleet a devastating defeat that resulted in an end to the Russo-Swedish War of 1788–90. The battle is the biggest Swedish naval victory and the largest naval battle ever in the Baltic Sea. Paragraph 6: Battle of Tannenberg The Battle of Tannenberg was fought between Russia and Germany from 26–30 August 1914, during the first month of World War I. The battle resulted in the almost complete destruction of the Russian Second Army and the suicide of its commanding general, Alexander Samsonov. A series of follow-up battles (First Masurian Lakes) destroyed most of the First Army as well and kept the Russians off balance until the spring of 1915. The battle is particularly notable for fast rail movements by the Germans, enabling them to concentrate against each of the two Russian armies in turn, and also for the failure of the Russians to encode their radio messages. It brought considerable prestige to Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg and his rising staff-officer Erich Ludendorff. Paragraph 7: Operation Michael Operation \"Michael\" was a major German military offensive during the First World War that began the Spring Offensive on 21 March 1918. It was launched from the Hindenburg Line, in the vicinity of Saint-Quentin, France. Its goal was to break through the Allied (Entente) lines and advance in a north-westerly direction to seize the Channel ports, which supplied the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) and to drive the BEF into the sea. Two days later General Ludendorff, the Chief of the German General Staff, changed his plan and pushed for an offensive due west, along the whole of the British front north of the River Somme. This was designed to separate the French and British Armies and crush the British forces by pushing them into the sea. The offensive ended at Villers-Bretonneux, to the east of the Allied communications centre at Amiens, where the Allies managed to halt the German advance; the German Armies had suffered many casualties and were unable to maintain supplies to the advancing troops. Paragraph 8: Battle of Anholt The Battle of Anholt (25–27 March 1811) occurred during the Gunboat War, a war between the United Kingdom and Denmark-Norway. It was an attempt by the Danes to recapture Anholt, a small Danish island off the coast of Jutland, which the British had captured in 1809. The Danish army had a larger fighting force than the British, but a lack of planning and supply failures led to a devastating defeat and many Danish casualties. After the battle, the British occupation of Anholt continued until the peace treaty in 1814. There is a monument commemorating the battle in Anholt village. Paragraph 9: First Battle of the Marne The Battle of the Marne (French: Première bataille de la Marne , also known as the Miracle of the Marne, \"Le Miracle de la Marne\") was a World War I battle fought from 6–10 September 1914. It resulted in an Allied victory against the German armies in the west. The battle was the culmination of the German advance into France and pursuit of the Allied armies which followed the Battle of the Frontiers in August and had reached the eastern outskirts of Paris. A counter-attack by six French armies and the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) along the Marne River forced the Imperial German Army to retreat north-west, leading to the First Battle of the Aisne and the Race to the Sea. The battle was a victory for the Allies but led to four years of trench warfare stalemate on the Western Front. Paragraph 10: Polish–Soviet War in 1919 In 1918, the German Army in the east was the most powerful force in the region. Even more importantly, it was not only undefeated, it was victorious (in contrast to the German Army on the western front). However the commander of the German forces in the east, Max Hoffmann, a chief negotiator in the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, was facing increasing difficulties. He believed, rightly, that his army was the only stabilising influence over the Eastern Europe. Yet with the disintegration of Austria-Hungary, rise of Bolsheviks in the east and various independent governments between the former frontline and Germany, the former \"Oberkommando-Ostfront\" (or \"Ober-Ost\") occupation zone became a thin line to nowhere, connected only to still-German Prussia. The deteriorating situation in Germany, facing the threat of civil war, eventually forced Hoffman to begin to retreat westwards, to Germany, in December 1918. Demoralized officers and mutinous soldiers abandoned their garrisons \"en masse\" and returned home. Only a limited number of units still retained any combat strength. Q: Max Hoffmann along with Hindenburg and Ludendorff, masterminded the devastating defeat of the Russian armies in a battle fought when ?\n"

Paragraph 4: Prachethasa Prachetasa is considered to be one of the most mysterious figures of Hindu mythology. It is an epithet for Varuna the god of water and its principle and as such are related to ‘shatabhoisag’ asterism. According to the puranas Prachetasa was one of the 10 Prajapatis who were ancient sages and law gives. But there is also a reference to 10 Prachetas who were sons of Prachinabarthis and great grandsons of Prithu. It is said that they lived for 10,000 years in a great ocean, very deeply engaged in meditation upon Vishnu and obtained from Him the boon of becoming the progenitors of mankind. They married a girl named Manisha, a daughter of Kanclu . Daksha was their son. But according to another version it is said that Prajapathi Daksha an ancient sage and contemporary of Lord Shiva, gave his 27 daughters in marriage to Soma ( Chandra). Soma was born from Marichi. But it is also said that Daksha was also the son of a woman called Marichi. Marichi is again referred to as the mother of Daksha. Thus it appears that Prachetasas were Daksha’s fathers as well as Daksha’s great grandsons. This confusion arises in Hindu families essentially because children are often named after their grandfather or great grandfather.

Jack Arnold, who had directed the first two films in the series, had moved on to \"A-list\" films, and felt he had no more to contribute to the horror genre. He suggested that his assistant director, Sherwood, could move up to full director, which partly affected Universal's decision to allow him to direct the film. \"The Creature Walks Among Us\" starred Jeff Morrow, Rex Reason, and Leigh Snowden, and, like the original \"Creature from the Black Lagoon\", had music composed by Henry Mancini, who at the time was under contract with Universal.

      "2024-02-13 22:32:00,601 - INFO - Paragraph 1: Suzanne Simone Baptiste Louverture Suzanne Simone Baptiste Louverture (around 1742 – May 19, 1816 in Agen, France) was the wife of Toussaint Louverture and the \"Dame-Consort\" of the French colony of Saint-Domingue. Paragraph 2: War of Knives The War of Knives (French: \"Guerre des couteaux\"), also known as the War of the South, was a civil war from June 1799 to July 1800 between the Haitian revolutionary Toussaint Louverture, a black ex-slave who controlled the north of Saint-Domingue (modern-day Haiti), and his adversary André Rigaud, a free colored person of mixed race who controlled the south. Louverture and Rigaud fought over de facto control of the French colony of Saint-Domingue during the war, which took place after the two men had successfully expelled foreign forces from the colony as part of the Haitian Revolution. The war resulted in Toussaint taking control of the entirety of Saint-Domingue, and Rigaud fleeing into exile. Paragraph 3: Jean Baptiste Brunet Jean Baptiste Brunet (7 July 1763 – 21 September 1824) was a French general of division in the French Revolutionary Army. He was responsible for the arrest of Toussaint Louverture. He was promoted to command a light infantry demi-brigade at the Fleurus in 1794. He led the unit in François Joseph Lefebvre's division in the 1795, 1796 and 1799 campaigns. He was the son of French general Gaspard Jean-Baptiste Brunet who was guillotined in 1793. Paragraph 4: Toussaint L'Overture County Cemetery The Toussaint L'Ouverture County Cemetery is an historical African-American cemetery located in Franklin, Tennessee. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. It is named for Toussaint Louverture, the leader of the Haitian Revolution. The earliest recorded burials date from 1869, but it wasn't officially incorporated until 1884. It is \"the oldest African American institution in continuous use\" in Williamson County. Paragraph 5: Sanité Bélair Suzanne Bélair, called \"Sanité Bélair\", (1781 – 5 October 1802), was a Haitian Freedom fighter and revolutionary, lieutenant in the army of Toussaint Louverture. Paragraph 6: Toussaint Louverture François-Dominique Toussaint Louverture (] 20 May 1743 – 7 April 1803), also known as Toussaint L'Ouverture or Toussaint Bréda, was the best-known leader of the Haitian Revolution. His military and political acumen saved the gains of the first Black insurrection in November 1791. He first fought for the Spanish against the French; then for France against Spain and Great Britain; and finally, for Saint-Domingue against Napoleonic France. He then helped transform the insurgency into a revolutionary movement, which by 1800 had turned Saint-Domingue, the most prosperous slave colony of the time, into the first free colonial society to have explicitly rejected race as the basis of social ranking. Paragraph 7: Revolution (Nina Simone song) \"Revolution\" is a 1969 song by American jazz musician Nina Simone and Weldon Irvine. It was released as a single in 1969 and on the album \"To Love Somebody\" in 1969. The single release was split over two sides of a 45 rpm disc and these two edits were used as separate tracks on the album. The song was released the year after the Beatles' \"Revolution\", and is seen by some as a variation of that song. \"Revolution\" didn't do as well as expected and Simone has expressed surprise and disappointment at its lack of success. Paragraph 8: Simone Torres Simone Torres arrives in the fictional town of Pine Valley, Pennsylvania in 2001 at the behest of Edmund Grey in order to aid his brother-in-law Mateo Santos uncover the identity of the drug lord \"Proteus\". An investigative reporter, Simone works to find Proteus's true identity while pretending to be engaged in an affair with Mateo, in order to protect the latter's wife and son from Proteus's wrath. Simone falls in love with Mateo, but it is clear his heart lies with his wife Hayley. Simone mistakenly believes that a legitimate book publisher is interested in her authoring a book on the investigation. Revealing inside information to the publisher, Simone is shocked when it turns out to be a front set up by \"Vanessa Cortlandt\", the real Proteus. As a result of Simone's leak, FBI agent \"Chris Stamp\" is almost killed. A furious Mateo distances himself from Simone. Paragraph 9: United States and the Haitian Revolution The Haitian Revolution provoked mixed reactions in the United States. In June 1793 when the Haitian people, led by Toussaint Louverture, overthrew the French colonial rule and declared themselves an independent colony, it made the neighboring United States uneasy. The slaves in Saint-Domingue’s were able to observe the growing disunity among the white colonists and themselves. They realized that they would need to seek an opportunity to stop the tyranny that was being placed upon them, thus they took a stand and revolted. The Haitian Revolution of 1804 impacted the United States of America, led by Thomas Jefferson, instilling fear of racial instability in the US, and the possible problematic effect the revolution could have on the early foreign relations and trade between the US and the new independent Haiti. Thomas Jefferson realized that the Haitian Revolution had the potential to cause an upheaval against slavery in the US not only by the slaves themselves, but by white abolitionists as well. Southern slaveholders feared that the revolt might spread from the island of Hispaniola to the slave plantations of the Southern United States. The primary goal of the US was to maintain social order in the country, so the United States attempted to suppress the Haitian Revolution. The US even went as far as to refuse acknowledgement of Haitian independence until 1862, which was during the heat of the North American civil war; coincidentally the main causal factor for the war between the states was slavery. The second major impact that the Haitian Revolution had on the United States was on early foreign relations and trade that had been conducted with Haiti. The United States had conducted trade and commerce with the Haitian island under French rule during the eighteenth century. Haiti was the main producer of the United States supply of sugar and coffee, and once the Haitian slave population had broken from slavery, the US was reluctant to continue trade with them in fear that they would upset the French and the Southern slaveholders. American merchants conducted a substantial trade with the plantations on Hispaniola (aka the French colony of Saint Domingue or Haiti). But there were anti-slavery advocates in northern cities who believed that consistency with the principles of the American Revolution — life, liberty and equality for all—demanded that the U.S. support the slave insurgents. An extremely beneficial aspect and real estate triumph that resulted from the Haitian Revolution and impacted the United States was the Louisiana Purchase. Once Napoleon had lost his control of the land holding in the Caribbean to the Haitian rebellion, he felt that the French territory in the southern part of the United States was useless to the French Empire. The US was only interested in the New Orleans area; however, the revolution enabled the sale of the entire territory west of the Mississippi River for around $15 million. This purchase more than doubled the United States’ territory. Paragraph 10: Joseph Saint-Rémy Joseph Saint-Rémy (1818 - 1856) was a Haitian historian. He is best known for his biography \"La Vie de Toussaint Louverture\" about the Haitian Revolution leader Toussaint L'Ouverture, and for his work \"Pétion et Haïti\", about another Revolutionary figure, Alexandre Pétion. Born in Guadeloupe, Saint-Rémy emigrated to Haiti as a young child and grew up in Les Cayes before leaving for school in France.

      "2024-02-15 20:48:34,153 - INFO - Paragraph 1: Albert Speer Berthold Konrad Hermann Albert Speer ( ; ] ; March 19, 1905 – September 1, 1981) was a German architect who was, for most of World War II, Reich Minister of Armaments and War Production for Nazi Germany. Speer was Adolf Hitler's chief architect before assuming ministerial office. As \"the Nazi who said sorry\", he accepted moral responsibility at the Nuremberg trials and in his memoirs for complicity in crimes of the Nazi regime, while insisting he had been ignorant of the Holocaust. Paragraph 2: Hermann Giesler Hermann Giesler (April 2, 1898, Siegen – January 20, 1987, Düsseldorf) was a German architect during the Nazi era, one of the two architects most favoured and rewarded by Adolf Hitler (the other being Albert Speer). Paragraph 3: Minister of Materials The Minister of Materials was a short-lived ministerial office in the Government of the United Kingdom, in charge of the Ministry of Materials. Created on 6 July 1951, the office was wound up on 16 August 1954. Most of its holders also held another ministerial office. Paragraph 4: Animal welfare in Nazi Germany There was widespread support for animal welfare in Nazi Germany among the country's leadership. Adolf Hitler and his top officials took a variety of measures to ensure animals were protected. Many Nazi leaders, including Hitler and Hermann Göring, were supporters of animal rights and conservation. Several Nazis were environmentalists, and species protection and animal welfare were significant issues in the Nazi regime. Heinrich Himmler made an effort to ban the hunting of animals. Göring was a professed animal lover and conservationist, who, on instructions from Hitler, committed Germans who violated Nazi animal welfare laws to concentration camps. In his private diaries, Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels described Hitler as a vegetarian whose hatred of the Jewish and Christian religions in large part stemmed from the ethical distinction these faiths drew between the value of humans and the value of other animals; Goebbels also mentions that Hitler planned to ban slaughterhouses in the German Reich following the conclusion of World War II. Paragraph 5: Personal standard of Adolf Hitler The personal standard of Adolf Hitler was designed after Reichspräsident Paul von Hindenburg died on 2 August 1934. Adolf Hitler abolished the title \"Reichspräsident\" and in its place instituted the title of \"Führer\" which henceforth could only be used when referring to him personally. Hindenburg used a personal standard consisting of a black eagle on a square gold background edged by a border of black, white and red bands. Hitler decided on 19 August 1934 to adopt a personal standard for himself, which was called \"Personal standard for Adolf Hitler as Leader and Chancellor of the German Nation\". As he was also Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces it was somewhat later known as \"The personal standard for Adolf Hitler as Leader and Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces\" (German: \"Standarte des Führers und Obersten Befehlshabers der Wehrmacht\"). Paragraph 6: Fuhrer city A Fuhrer city, or Führerstadt in German, was a status given to five German cities in 1937 by Adolf Hitler, the dictator of Nazi Germany. The status was based on Hitler's vision of undertaking gigantic urban transformation projects in these cities based on his own conceptions as executed by German architects including Albert Speer, Paul Ludwig Troost, German Bestelmeyer, Konstanty Gutschow, Hermann Giesler, Leonhard Gall and Paul Otto August Baumgarten. More modest reconstruction projects were to take place in thirty-five other cities, although some sources assert this number was as high as fifty. These plans were however not realised for the greater part because of the onset of the Second World War, although construction continued to take place even in wartime circumstances at Hitler's insistence. Paragraph 7: Hitler: Memoirs of a Confidant Hitler: Memoirs of a Confidant are the published memoirs written by Otto Wagener about Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party's early history. A German major general by the end for World War II and, for a period, Wagener was Adolf Hitler's party economist, chief of staff of the SA, and confidant, whose career was derailed by rival Hermann Göring. Wagener wrote his memoirs in 1946 while being held by the British, filling “thirty-six British military exercise notebooks.” His work was not published until seven years after his death, in 1978 in German. The English edition was published in 1985 by Yale University Press. His memoirs are used, to some degree, by Third Reich historians. Paragraph 8: Aryan Games The Aryan Games (German: \"Arische Spiele\" ) were a proposed replacement for the Olympic Games in the Third Reich. Proposed by Nazi sports organizer Carl Diem and subsequently adopted by Adolf Hitler, these multi-sport games were supposed to be housed permanently in Nuremberg at the planned \"German Stadium\", that had been designed by Nazi architect Albert Speer, but was never built. Paragraph 9: Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler order of battle The Leibstandarte SS \"Adolf Hitler\" (LSSAH) was founded in September 1933 as Adolf Hitler's personal Bodyguard formation. It was given the title \"Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler\" (LAH) in November, 1933. On 13 April 1934, by order of Himmler, the regiment became known as the \"Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler\" (LSSAH). In 1939 the LSSAH became a separate unit of the Waffen-SS aside the SS-TV and the SS-VT. Paragraph 10: Advanced School of the NSDAP The Advanced School of the NSDAP (German: \"Hohe Schule der NSDAP\" , literally \"High School of the NSDAP\") was a project by the chief ideologist of the Nazi Party Alfred Rosenberg to create an elite Nazi university, a kind of academy for party officials. A monumental central university building was to be built on the shores of Lake Chiemsee, based on the architectural plans of Hermann Giesler. Q: The Nazi architect that was most rewarded and favoured by Adolf Hitler alongside Hermann Giesler held what type of ministerial office?A: Architect\n"

      "2024-02-15 20:48:37,611 - INFO - Paragraph 1: Siege of Béxar The Siege of Béxar (or Bejar) was an early campaign of the Texas Revolution in which a volunteer Texian army defeated Mexican forces at San Antonio de Béxar (now San Antonio, Texas, US). Texians had become disillusioned with the Mexican government as President and General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna's tenure became increasingly dictatorial. In early October, 1835, Texas settlers gathered in Gonzales to stop Mexican troops from reclaiming a small cannon. The resulting skirmish, known as the Battle of Gonzales, launched the Texas Revolution. Men continued to assemble in Gonzales and soon established the Texian Army. Despite a lack of military training, well-respected local leader General Stephen F. Austin was elected commander. Paragraph 2: Fort Bend Fort Bend was a blockhouse built in a large bend of the Brazos River in what is now Fort Bend County, Texas, to provide protection against Indian raids. It was erected in November 1822 by several members of Stephen F. Austin's Old Three Hundred, including William W. Little, Joseph Polley, William Smithers[Smeathers], Charles Beard, Henry Holster and is described as a \"little log shanty.\" The location was reportedly selected by Austin, and a settlement soon grew up around the post. As the site provided one of the more favorable fords of the Brazos River, it became important during the Texas Revolution. The Fort Bend crossing was briefly defended in April 1836 by a rear guard detachment led by Wiley Martin. After Martin was maneuvered out of the position Gen. Antonio López de Santa Anna transported a portion of his Mexican army across the Brazos at the crossing. After Santa Anna's defeat at the battle of San Jacinto the site was used briefly by the Texas army. Troops under Thomas Jefferson Green, who were in pursuit of retreating Mexican forces led by Gen. Vicente Filisola, halted for a short time in mid-May 1836 at Fort Bend. Because Fort Bend had been the center of activity in the area its name was given to the county when it was established in 1837. The next year nearby Richmond, Texas was selected as the county seat and soon absorbed the smaller Fort Bend settlement. In 1936 the Texas Centennial Commission erected a monument to commemorate Fort Bend's role in the Texas Revolution. Paragraph 3: José de Urrea José de Urrea (March 19, 1797 – August 1, 1849) was a Mexican general. He fought under General Antonio López de Santa Anna during the Texas Revolution. Urrea's forces were never defeated in battle during the Texas Revolution. His most notable success was that of the Goliad Campaign, in which James Fannin's 400 soldiers were surrounded and induced to capitulate under terms, but were massacred in Urrea's absence on the orders of Santa Anna. Urrea also fought in the Mexican-American War. Paragraph 4: Battle of San Jacinto The Battle of San Jacinto, fought on April 21, 1836, in present-day Harris County, Texas, was the decisive battle of the Texas Revolution. Led by General Sam Houston, the Texian Army engaged and defeated General Antonio López de Santa Anna's Mexican army in a fight that lasted just 18 minutes. Paragraph 5: Grass Fight The Grass Fight was a small battle during the Texas Revolution, fought between the Mexican Army and the Texian Army. The battle took place on November 26, 1835, just south of San Antonio de Béxar in the Mexican region of Texas. The Texas Revolution had officially begun on October 2 and by the end of the month the Texian had initiated a siege of Béxar, home of the largest Mexican garrison in the province. Bored with the inactivity, many of the Texian soldiers returned home; a smaller number of adventurers from the United States arrived to replace them. After the Texian Army rejected commander-in-chief Stephen F. Austin's call to launch an assault on Béxar on November 22, Austin resigned from the army. The men elected Edward Burleson their new commander-in-chief. Paragraph 6: Runaway Scrape The Runaway Scrape events took place mainly between September 1835 and April 1836, and were the evacuations by Texas residents fleeing the Mexican Army of Operations during the Texas Revolution, from the Battle of the Alamo through the decisive Battle of San Jacinto. The \"ad interim\" government of the new Republic of Texas and much of the civilian population fled eastward ahead of the Mexican forces. The conflict arose after Antonio López de Santa Anna abrogated the 1824 constitution of Mexico and established martial law in Coahuila y Tejas. The Texians resisted and declared their independence. It was Sam Houston's responsibility, as the appointed commander-in-chief of the Provisional Army of Texas (before such an army actually existed), to recruit and train a military force to defend the population against troops led by Santa Anna. Paragraph 7: Sarahville de Viesca, Texas Sarahville de Viesca or Fort Milam or Bucksnort is a ghost town in Falls County, Texas, United States. The settlement was established in 1834 by Sterling C. Robertson and named for his mother Mrs. Sarah (née Maclin) Robertson and Agustín Viesca, the Mexican governor of Coahuila y Tejas. The site was located at the falls of the Brazos River, where the river formerly dropped 10 ft and where a well-used ford was located. The town was temporarily deserted in 1836 during the Runaway Scrape and permanently abandoned soon afterward because of native American raids. Fort Milam was built on the west-bank site but abandoned a few years later in favor of the town of Bucksnort which occupied the east bank. Bucksnort vanished when the nearby town of Marlin was founded. There is a county park and historical marker located where Farm to Market Road 712 crosses the Brazos south of Marlin. Paragraph 8: Army of the Republic of Texas The Army of the Republic of Texas was the land-based component of the armed forces for the Republic of Texas. It directly descended from the Texian Army, which was established on October 2, 1835, to fight for independence from Mexico in the Texas Revolution. The army was provisionally formed from the Consultation in November 1835, and officially established on September 5, 1836, from Article II, Section 5 of the Constitution of the Republic of Texas. After Texas' annexation by the United States, the Army of the Republic of Texas was merged into the United States Army. Today, the 141st Infantry Regiment trace their lineage back to the Texas Revolution. Paragraph 9: 2013 Texas Revolution season The 2013 Texas Revolution season was the team's fourteenth season as a football franchise, fourth in the Indoor Football League (IFL), and first as the \"Texas Revolution\". One of just nine teams competing in the IFL for the 2013 season, the Texas Revolution were realigned to the United Conference. The team played their home games at the Allen Event Center in Allen, Texas. Head coach Billy Back led the team to a 5–9 record and they failed to qualify for post-season play. Paragraph 10: 2014 Texas Revolution season The 2014 Texas Revolution season was the team's fifteenth season as a professional indoor football franchise, fifth in the Indoor Football League (IFL), and second as the \"Texas Revolution\". One of nine teams in the IFL for the 2014 season, the Texas Revolution competed in the United Conference for the second consecutive year. The team played their home games at the Allen Event Center in Allen, Texas. Chris Williams returned to the IFL as the Texas Revolution's director of football operations and head coach for 2014. The team started strong but faltered, compiling a 3–11 record and missing the playoffs. In the post-season, Williams resigned and the team announced their departure from the IFL. Q: Runaway Scrape events of the Texas Revolution, culminating in this Battle, was a fight that lasted how long?A: 18 minutes\n"

In 1 Kings 18, Elijah defended the worship of the Jewish God over that of the Canaanite deity Baal. God also performed many miracles through Elijah, including resurrection (raising the dead), bringing fire down from the sky, and entering Heaven alive \"by a whirlwind\". He is also portrayed as leading a school of prophets known as \"the sons of the prophets\". Following his ascension, Elisha his disciple and most devoted assistant took over his role as leader of this school. The Book of Malachi prophesies Elijah's return \"before the coming of the great and terrible day of the LORD\", making him a harbinger of the Messiah and of the eschaton in various faiths that revere the Hebrew Bible. References to Elijah appear in Ecclesiasticus, the New Testament, the Mishnah and Talmud, the Quran, the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and Bahá'í writings. Paragraph 2: Lot in Islam Lut ibn Haran (Arabic: لوط‎ , \"Lūṭ \" ‎ ), known as Lot in the Old Testament, is a prophet of God in the Quran. He also appears in the Bible, but the biblical stories of Lot are not entirely accepted within Islam. According to Islamic tradition, Lot lived in Ur and was the son of Haran and nephew of Abraham. He migrated with Abraham to Canaan. He was bestowed as a prophet to the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. He was commanded by God to go to the land of Sodom and Gomorrah to preach to his people on monotheism and to stop them from their lustful and violent acts. According to both the Quran and the Hebrew Bible, Lot's messages were ignored by the inhabitants and Sodom and Gomorrah were subsequently destroyed. Their sites cannot be exactly located, but it may be supposed that they were somewhere in the plain east of the Dead Sea or underneath its current limits. Lot's story is traditionally presented as an Islamic view against rape and homosexual acts. Paragraph 3: Serpents in the Bible Serpents (Hebrew: נחש‎ ‎ \"nāḥāš\") are referred to in both the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament. The symbol of a serpent or snake played important roles in religious and cultural life of ancient Egypt, Canaan, Mesopotamia and Greece. The serpent was a symbol of evil power and chaos from the underworld as well as a symbol of fertility, life and healing. \"Nachash\", Hebrew for \"snake\", is also associated with divination, including the verb-form meaning to practice divination or fortune-telling. In the Hebrew Bible, \"Nachash\" occurs in the Torah to identify the serpent in Eden. Throughout the Hebrew Bible, it is also used in conjunction with \"saraph\" to describe vicious serpents in the wilderness. \"Tanniyn\", a form of dragon-monster, also occurs throughout the Hebrew Bible. In the Book of Exodus, the staffs of Moses and Aaron are turned into serpents, a \"nachash\" for Moses, a \"tanniyn\" for Aaron. In the New Testament, the Book of Revelation makes use of \"ancient serpent\" and \"the Dragon\" several times to identify Satan or the devil. (; ) The serpent is most often identified with the hubristic Satan, and sometimes with Lilith. Paragraph 4: Biblical and Quranic narratives The Quran, the central religious text of Islam, contains references to more than fifty people and events also found in the Bible. While the stories told in each book are generally comparable in most respects, important differences sometimes emerge. Many stories in the Bible are not mentioned at all in the Quran and many stories in the Quran are not mentioned in the Bible. Paragraph 5: Book of Nahum The Book of Nahum is the seventh book of the 12 minor prophets of the Hebrew Bible. It is attributed to the prophet Nahum, and was probably written in Jerusalem in the 7th century BC. Paragraph 6: Human rights in the Quran In its Arabic texts, the Quran is considered the primary source of authority by Muslims. The Quran is a relatively short book of 77,000 words that are divided into one hundred and fourteen chapters (Suras). A hundred and thirteen of the chapters of the Quran begin with an indication of the book’s intent (In the name of God the All- Compassionate and the Ever-Merciful). The book is largely concerned with establishing boundaries that Muslims are prohibited from transgressing. Within these boundaries the Quran treats human beings as equally valuable and endowed with certain rights by virtue of simply being human, hence Human rights. The rights bestowed upon humans in the Quran include the right to life and peaceful living, as well as the right to own, protect, and have property protected, Islamic economic jurisprudence. The Quran also contains rights for minority groups and women, as well as regulations of human interactions as between one another to the extent of dictating how Prisoners of war ought to be treated. Paragraph 7: Book of Judges The Book of Judges (Hebrew: \"Sefer Shoftim\" ספר שופטים) is the seventh book of the Hebrew Bible and the Christian Bible. It contains the history of the Biblical judges, the divinely inspired leaders whose direct knowledge of Yahweh allows them to act as champions for the Israelites against oppression by foreign rulers, and models of the wise and faithful behaviour required of them by their God Yahweh following the exodus from Egypt and the conquest of Canaan. The stories follow a consistent pattern: the people are unfaithful to Yahweh and he therefore delivers them into the hands of their enemies; the people repent and entreat Yahweh for mercy, which he sends in the form of a leader or champion (a \"judge\"); the judge delivers the Israelites from oppression and they prosper, but soon they fall again into unfaithfulness and the cycle is repeated. Scholars consider many of the stories in \"Judges\" to be the oldest in the Deuteronomistic history, with their major redaction dated to the 8th century BCE and with materials such as the Song of Deborah dating from much earlier, perhaps close to the period the book depicts. Paragraph 8: Talut Talut (Arabic: طالوت‎ ‎ , \"Ṭālūt\") is considered to be the Qur’anic name for Saul, as he was the \"Malik\" (Arabic: مَـلِـك‎ ‎ , King) of Israel, or Gideon, with the reasoning that the Quran references the same incident of the drinking from the river as that found in the Book of Judges (7:5-7), and other factors associated with the latter. Paragraph 9: Biblical allusions in Shakespeare According to Dr. Naseeb Shaheen, Shakespeare, in writing his plays, \"seldom borrows biblical references from his sources, even when those sources contain many references.\" Roy Battenhouse notes that the Shakespearean tragedy \"frequently echoes Bible language or paradigm, even when the play's setting is pagan.\" Similarly, Peter Milward notes that despite their secular appearance, Shakespeare's plays \"conceal an undercurrent of religious meaning which belongs to their deepest essence.\" Further, Milward maintains that although Shakespeare \"may have felt obliged by the circumstances of the Elizabethan stage to avoid Biblical or other religious subjects for his plays,\" such obligation \"did not prevent him from making full use of the Bible in dramatizing his secular sources and thus infusing into them a Biblical meaning.\" Milward continues that, in writing his plays (in particular, the tragedies), Shakespeare \"shows the universal relevance of the Bible both to the reality of human life 'in this harsh world' and to its ideal in the heart of God.\" Steven Marx suggests \"a thorough familiarity with the Scriptures\" is a prerequisite to understanding the Biblical references in the plays, and that the plays' references to the Bible \"illuminate fresh and surprising meanings in the biblical text.\" Marx further notes that \"it is possible that Shakespeare sometimes regarded his own role of playwright and performer as godlike, his own book as potent and capacious as 'The Book'.\" It is important to note, as a recent study points out “The diversity of versions reflected in Shakespeare’s writing indicates that ‘Shakespeare’s Bible’ cannot be taken for granted as unitary, since it consists of a network of different translations” Paragraph 10: Moses in Islam Mûsâ ibn 'Imran (Arabic: ٰمُوسَى‎ , \"Mūsā \" ‎ ) known as Moses in the Hebrew Bible, considered a prophet, messenger, and leader in Islam, is the most frequently mentioned individual in the Quran. In Islamic tradition, instead of introducing a new religion, Musa is regarded by Muslims as teaching and practicing the religion of his predecessors and confirming the scriptures and prophets before him. The Quran states that Moses was sent by God to the Pharaoh of Egypt and the Israelites for guidance and warning. Moses is mentioned more in the Quran than any other individual, and his life is narrated and recounted more than that of any other prophet. According to Islam, all Muslims must have faith in every prophet (\"nabi\") and messenger (\"rasul\") which includes Moses and his brother Aaron (\"Harun\"). The Quran states: Q: What is the seventh book of the Hebrew and Christina bible and also has Quran references to the river drinking experience?A: Judges\n"

      "2024-02-15 20:48:57,562 - INFO - Paragraph 1: Block booking Block booking is a system of selling multiple films to a theater as a unit. Block booking was the prevailing practice among Hollywood's major studios from the turn of the 1930s until it was outlawed by the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in \"United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.\" (1948). Under block booking, \"independent ('unaffiliated') theater owners were forced to take large numbers of [a] studio's pictures sight unseen. Those studios could then parcel out second-rate product along with A-class features and star vehicles, which made both production and distribution operations more economical.\" The element of the system involving the purchase of unseen pictures is known as blind bidding. Paragraph 2: Baker v. Nelson Richard John Baker v. Gerald R. Nelson, 291 Minn. 310, 191 N.W.2d 185 (1971) is a case in which the Minnesota Supreme Court ruled that a state law limiting marriage to persons of the opposite sex did not violate the U.S. Constitution. Baker appealed, and on October 10, 1972, the United States Supreme Court dismissed the appeal \"for want of a substantial federal question.\" Because the case came to the U.S. Supreme Court through mandatory appellate review (not \"certiorari\"), the dismissal constituted a decision on the merits and established \"Baker v. Nelson\" as precedent, though the extent of its precedential effect had been subject to debate. In May 2013, Minnesota legalized same-sex marriage and it took effect on August 1, 2013. Subsequently, on June 26, 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court explicitly overruled \"Baker\" in \"Obergefell v. Hodges\" making same-sex marriage legal nationwide. Paragraph 3: United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc. United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc., 334 US 131 (1948) (also known as the Hollywood Antitrust Case of 1948, the Paramount Case, the Paramount Decision or the Paramount Decree) was a landmark United States Supreme Court antitrust case that decided the fate of movie studios owning their own theatres and holding exclusivity rights on which theatres would show their films. It would also change the way Hollywood movies were produced, distributed, and exhibited. The Court held in this case that the existing distribution scheme was in violation of the antitrust laws of the United States, which prohibit certain exclusive dealing arrangements. Paragraph 4: R v Van der Peet R v Van der Peet, [1996] 2 S.C.R. 507 is a leading case on Aboriginal rights under section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982. The Supreme Court held that Aboriginal fishing rights did not extend to commercial selling of fish. From this case came the Van der Peet test for determining if an Aboriginal right exists. This is the first of three cases known as the Van der Peet trilogy which included \"R v NTC Smokehouse Ltd\" and \"R v Gladstone\". Paragraph 5: United States v. Binion United States v. Binion, 132 F. App'x 89 (8th Cir. 2005), is a case in which the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit applied two recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions (\"United States v. Booker\", 543 U.S. 220 (2005) and \"United States v. Fanfan\", 543 U.S. 220 (2005) in reviewing the sentencing decision by the trial court and upheld by the Federal District Court for the Eastern District. Paragraph 6: Lau Kong Yung v Director of Immigration Lau Kong Yung v. Director of Immigration was a 1999 right of abode case in the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal following closely on the heels of the landmark \"Ng Ka Ling v. Director of Immigration\" decision earlier that year. After \"Ng\" and the two prior actions in \"Lau\", but before the case came before the CFA, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC) of the People's Republic of China issued an interpretation of the Basic Law which affected the rights of Lau and his fellow applicants. \"Lau\" thus became the first case in which the CFA had to take into account an NPCSC interpretation in applying the Basic Law. Paragraph 7: Craig v. Boren Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190 (1976) , was the first case in which a majority of the United States Supreme Court determined that statutory or administrative sex classifications were subject to intermediate scrutiny under the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. Paragraph 8: City of Norwood v. Horney Norwood, Ohio v. Horney 110 Ohio St.3d 353 was a case brought before the Ohio Supreme Court in 2006. The case came upon the heels of \"Kelo v. City of New London\", in which the United States Supreme Court ruled that commercial development justified the use of eminent domain. \"Kelo\" had involved the United States Constitution, while the issue in \"Norwood\" was the specific limitations of the Ohio State Constitution. Paragraph 9: Criminal law in the Waite Court During the tenure of Morrison Waite as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States (March 4, 1874 through March 23, 1888), the Supreme Court heard an unprecedented volume and frequency of criminal cases. In just fourteen years, the Court heard 106 criminal cases, almost as many cases as the Supreme Court had heard in the period from its creation to the appointment of Waite as Chief Justice. Notable cases include \"United States v. Cruikshank\" (1875), \"United States v. Reese\" (1875), \"Reynolds v. United States\" (1878), \"Wilkerson v. Utah\" (1879), the \"Trade-Mark Cases\" (1879), \"Strauder v. West Virginia\" (1880), \"Pace v. Alabama\" (1883), \"United States v. Harris\" (1883), \"Ex parte Crow Dog\" (1883), \"Hurtado v.

In 2015, she served as president of the American Chemical Society (ACS).

      "2024-02-15 20:49:31,273 - INFO - Paragraph 1: List of magazines in Malaysia The first women's magazine was published in Malaysia in 1932. In the 2000s there were nearly fifty local titles addressing women in the country. These magazines also include those having an Islamic perspective. Some international women's magazines are also published in Malaysia. One of them is \"Elle Malaysia\", which was first published in March 2014. Another one, \"Women’s Health\", was started in April 2015. Comic magazines and film magazines are also common in Malaysia. Paragraph 2: List of magazines in Austria The magazine sector in Austria is under the dominance of Germany. This influence decreased at the end of the 1990s, but it continued on the women's magazines and fashion magazines. However, business magazines have not been subject to the dominance of Germany. The major fields of Austrian magazines are news, popular science and special interest topics. On the other hand, since the Austrian press market is divided between magazines and newspapers, magazines have a significant function in the press market. Paragraph 3: Transition House Association of Nova Scotia The Transition House Association of Nova Scotia (abbreviated THANS and TRANS) is a Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada-based organisation that runs women's shelters. Pamela Harrison is THANS's executive director, and also serves as provincial co-ordinator. Rhonda Fraser, the executive director of Chrysalis House, is a member of THANS. THANS organises an annual purple ribbon awareness campaign in memory of the École Polytechnique massacre. THANS was founded in 1989. THANS conducted interviews with 34 physically abused women who subsequently sought resolution through family law mediation. In 2000, THANS released a report based on these interviews, stating that most of the women would not recommend legal mediation to other abused women. In 2008, THANS supported Bill 81, which they hoped would become the Domestic Violence Elimination Act, but Minister of Justice Cecil Clarke chose not to call the bill for a third reading. In 2009, Darrell Dexter of the New Democratic Party identified THANS in his promise to increase government funding of halfway houses in Nova Scotia. In 2012, THANS partnered with the World YWCA, Family SOS, Silent Witness Nova Scotia, and Leave Out Violence to host the Atlantic Ballet Theatre of Canada's \"Ghosts of Violence\", a ballet about domestic violence, in Halifax. Paragraph 4: Look (UK magazine) Look is a glossy high street fashion and celebrity weekly magazine for young women. It is published by Time Inc. UK, and edited by Ali Hall. The magazine focuses on fashion, high street shopping advice, celebrity style and news, and real-life stories. Paragraph 5: Lifestyle magazine Lifestyle magazine is an umbrella term for popular magazines concerned with lifestyle and is often used to encompass a number of men's magazines, women's magazines and magazines about health and fitness, tourism, leisure, fashion, decorating, or culture. The concept is chiefly used in reference to a magazine's tone. Paragraph 6: Customer magazine A customer magazine is a magazine produced by a business as a means of communicating to its customers. It is a branch of custom media, a product that broadly shares the look and feel of a newsstand or consumer magazine but is paid for in part or whole by a business. Rather than copy sales and advertising, the primary goal of a customer magazine is to achieve a particular business objective. This could be for a firm to cross- or up-sell, change brand perception or engender loyalty. In-flight magazines, sponsored by airlines, were among the first customer magazines, and remain typical of the genre. In the UK, every supermarket chain now provides a customer magazine to promote its products through recipes and other food editorial. Many prominent digitally-native companies, like WebMD and Net-À-Portér, have released customer magazines of their own. Some customer magazines carry advertising; this is often seen as a useful way to offset the cost but equally can have some benefit in making the product look more like a regular magazine. Paragraph 7: Chrysalis (magazine) Chrysalis: A Magazine of Women's Culture was a feminist publication produced from 1977 to 1980. The self-published magazine was founded by Kirsten Grimstad and Susan Rennie at the Woman's Building in downtown Los Angeles. \"Chysalis\" grew from Grimstad and Rennie's editorial work on the self-help resource books, The New Woman's Survival Catalog and The New Woman's Survival Sourcebook. \"Chrysalis\" distinguished itself from other feminist publications through an organic integration of politics, literature, cultural studies, and art. The magazine was produced through a collective process that grew out of the feminist practice of consciousness-raising. Unusually broad in scope, \"Chrysalis\" did not substitute breadth for quality. The authors, poets, essayists, and researchers contributing to the magazine reveals a veritable who's who of towering intellects of the feminist movement: black lesbian activist Audre Lorde; the magazine's poetry editor, Robin Morgan, who later served as editor of Ms. from 1990-1993: award winning poet Adrienne Rich; novelist Marge Percy; artist Judy Chicago; science fiction writer Joanna Russ; art critic Lucy Lippard, plus Mary Daly, Dolores Hayden, Andrea Dworkin, Marilyn Hacker, Arlene Raven, and Elizabeth Janeway. Over a three-year span, the all volunteer staff produced ten issues before they were forced to disband in 1981 due to financial difficulties. Paragraph 8: Rick Wilber Rick Wilber is an American author, poet, and editor. He has published more than thirty-five short stories in magazines such as \"Aboriginal SF\", \"Analog\", \"Asimov's Science Fiction\", \"Fantasy & Science Fiction\", \"Pulphouse\", and \"SF Age\"; and in anthologies such as \"Alien Sex\" and \"Chrysalis\". In addition to his short stories, he has written the novels \"Rum Point\", \"The Cold Road\", and \"Alien Morning\", as well as a memoir, \"My Father's Game: Life, Death, Baseball\", and several textbooks, including \"Modern Media Writing\" and \"Magazine Feature Writing\". Paragraph 9: List of magazines in Portugal Magazines in Portugal are mostly women's magazines, society magazines and TV magazines. In 1994 there were nearly 984 magazines in the country. Paragraph 10: Surfer hair Surfer hair is a tousled type of hairstyle, popularized by surfers from the 1950s onwards, traditionally long, thick and naturally bleached from high exposure to the sun and salt water of the sea. In the late 1960s and 1970s, the long hair and general lack of personal grooming was closely associated with hippie culture. Today, hairstyling companies brand their own hair gels, shampoos and hair wax to achieve the \"surfer look\", with hairstyles, often shorter than traditionally, which often require more grooming to achieve the permanent hair lift or intentional windswept look. Amongst women, fashion magazines have referred to \"sun streaked surfer hair\" as a desirable look for women, although genuine surfer hair is often heavily damaged by the elements. Q: Are  Chrysalis and Look both women's magazines?A: Yes\n"

He has collaborated with several musical artists including Norah Jones, Melody Gardot, Madeleine Peyroux, Nikki Yanofsky, and Lizz Wright. Paragraph 2: Hell on Earth (book series) Hell on Earth is the dark paranormal series by Jackie Kessler. It focuses on the former succubus Jezebel, now the mortal Jesse Harris, as she tries to avoid her Hellish past and learn how to be truly human. Hell, however, wants Jesse back, which is really putting a crimp on her human life. Paragraph 3: On the Pleasure of Hating Form: The form used in On the Pleasure of Hating is a nonfiction essay. A nonfiction essay is a short, nonfiction narrative work of prose literature that is analytic, speculative, or interpretive in nature, dealing with or offering opinions or conjectures upon facts and reality, and written from the author’s point of view. On the Pleasure of Hating is seen as an essay because it is written to express Hazlitt’s point of view on the lack of sympathy that people have. For example, on page 189, Hazlitt proceeds to explain that,“We learn to curb our will and keep our overt actions within the bounds of humanity, long before we can subdue our sentiments and imaginations to the same mild tone.”Hazlitt gives this example as he is about to kill a spider. Hazlitt comes to the realization that the spider has done nothing to harm him. Why should he kill the innocent spider if the spider just means to be crawling from one place to another? Hazlitt tries to make the reader comprehend that society is the one that has placed pressure on hating things just to avoid us from hating ourselves. Paragraph 4: Denise Affonço Denise Affonço (born in Phnom Penh, Cambodia) is an author who wrote about her sufferings under the Khmer Rouge in a powerful memoir \"To The End Of Hell\" (\"La Digues Des Veuves\") with an introduction by Jon Swain.

Paragraph 8: Maafa Maafa (or African Holocaust, Holocaust of Enslavement, or Black holocaust as alternatives) are political neologisms (popularized from 1998 onwards) used to describe the history and ongoing effects of atrocities inflicted on African people, particularly when committed by non-Africans, specifically in the context of the history of slavery, including the Arab Slave Trade and Atlantic Slave Trade, and argued as \"continued to the present day\" through imperialism, colonialism, and other forms of oppression. For example, Maulana Karenga (2001) puts slavery in the broader context of the \"Maafa\", suggesting that its effects exceed mere physical persecution and legal disenfranchisement: the \"destruction of human possibility involved redefining African humanity to the world, poisoning past, present and future relations with others who only know us through this stereotyping and thus damaging the truly human relations among peoples.\" Paragraph 9: Cho Oh-hyun Seorak Musan Cho Oh Hyun (Hangul: 조오현) (born in 1932 in Miryang in South Gyeongsang Province of South Korea) has lived in the mountains since he became a novice monk at the age of seven. Over the years he has written over a hundred poems, including many in sijo form. In 2007 he received the Cheong Chi-yong Literary Award for his book Distant Holy Man. He is Josil of Kibon Seonwon (Spiritual Master of Fundamental Seon Mediation Center) of Jogye Order of the Korean Buddhism at Baekdamsa Monastery and famous for his Poetry of Delusion.

Many authors have written on Seorak Musan Cho Oh Hyun. He became Josil of Kibon Seonwon (Spiritual Master of Fundamental Seon Mediation Center) of Jogye Order of the Korean Buddhism at Baekdamsa Monastery on 14 March 2014. He is renowned not only in South Korea but also in European and Asian countries like Germany, India, Sri Lanka, etc. for his poetry. He is also a painter. Lee (2011) described the Wisdom of the Social Awakening emerged in the Gathas of Searching the Bulls : centering on Musan Cho Oh-Hyun’s Gathas of Ten Ox Herding. He further elaborate that Seorak Musan Cho Oh-Hyun wrote Musan's Ten Ox Herding gathas as the process of his practice through Seon poems. He concluded that ox-herding story of Seorak Musan Cho Oh Hyun leads people to peaceful shelter to stop agony and awake the reality of the world truly. Ox-herding practice can be an alternative for awakening society. Lee (2013) discussed Musan Cho Oh Hyun and Ethics Education. He revealed that Musan Cho Oh Hyun’s approach to ethics education is humanistic. His teachings import the carriage of leading a life worthy of a human being. While embodying the transcendental ethics of Seon Buddhism, Musan teaches that in order to lead a truly human life, it is paramount for all mortals to respect the collective rules of communities. In his exposition of the Buddhist ethics, Musan shows a supple understanding that goes beyond Sila and Vinaya, the rules of daily Buddhist lives.

      "2024-02-15 20:49:56,511 - INFO - Paragraph 1: Variable universal life insurance Variable universal life insurance (often shortened to VUL) is a type of life insurance that builds a cash value. In a VUL, the cash value can be invested in a wide variety of separate accounts, similar to mutual funds, and the choice of which of the available separate accounts to use is entirely up to the contract owner. The 'variable' component in the name refers to this ability to invest in separate accounts whose values vary—they vary because they are invested in stock and/or bond markets. The 'universal' component in the name refers to the flexibility the owner has in making premium payments. The premiums can vary from nothing in a given month up to maximums defined by the Internal Revenue Code for life insurance. This flexibility is in contrast to whole life insurance that has fixed premium payments that typically cannot be missed without lapsing the policy (although one may exercise an Automatic Premium Loan feature, or surrender dividends to pay a Whole Life premium). Paragraph 2: John Douglas Pringle Award John Douglas Pringle Award or British Prize for Journalism is offered jointly by the British High Commission and the Australian National Press Club. It is named after a distinguished journalist, John Douglas Pringle. Paragraph 3: Whole life insurance Whole life insurance, or whole of life assurance (in the Commonwealth of Nations), sometimes called \"straight life\" or \"ordinary life,\" is a life insurance policy which is guaranteed to remain in force for the insured's entire lifetime, provided required premiums are paid, or to the maturity date. As a life insurance policy it represents a contract between the insured and insurer that as long as the contract terms are met, the insurer will pay the death benefit of the policy to the policy's beneficiaries when the insured dies. Because whole life policies are guaranteed to remain in force as long as the required premiums are paid, the premiums are typically much higher than those of term life insurance where the premium is fixed only for a limited term. Whole life premiums are fixed, based on the age of issue, and usually do not increase with age. The insured party normally pays premiums until death, except for limited pay policies which may be paid-up in 10 years, 20 years, or at age 65. Whole life insurance belongs to the cash value category of life insurance, which also includes universal life, variable life, and endowment policies. Paragraph 4: Hormonal imprinting Hormonal imprinting (HI) is a phenomenon which takes place at the first encounter between a hormone and its developing receptor in the critical periods of life (in unicellulars during the whole life) and determines the later signal transduction capacity of the cell. The most important period in mammals is the perinatal one, however this system can be imprinted at weaning, at puberty and in case of continuously dividing cells during the whole life. Faulty imprinting is caused by drugs, environmental pollutants and other hormone-like molecules present in excess at the critical periods with lifelong receptorial, morphological, biochemical and behavioral consequences. HI is transmitted to the hundreds of progeny generations in unicellulars and (as proved) to a few generations also in mammals. Paragraph 5: John Douglas, 7th Marquess of Queensberry John Douglas, 7th Marquess of Queensberry (1779 – 19 December 1856), styled Lord John Douglas from May to December 1837, was a Scottish Whig politician. Paragraph 6: Gibson's albatross Gibson's albatross (\"Diomedea antipodensis gibsoni\"), also known as the Auckland Islands wandering albatross or Gibson's wandering albatross, is a large seabird in the great albatross group of the albatross family. The common name and trinomial commemorate John Douglas Gibson, an Australian amateur ornithologist who studied albatrosses off the coast of New South Wales for thirty years. Paragraph 7: Gibson Plumage Index The Gibson Plumage Index (GPI), sometimes known as the Gibson Code, is a system for describing the plumage of great albatrosses. It is named after, and originally devised in the late 1950s by, John Douglas Gibson and other members of the New South Wales Albatross Study Group. Gibson was an Australian amateur ornithologist who carried out fieldwork on albatrosses along the coast of New South Wales for thirty years. The index assigns separate numerical values (from 1 to 6 with increasing proportion of white) to the degrees of colouration on four parts of the body - the back, head, inner wing and tail - of albatrosses to indicate variations in age and between different breeding populations. For instance, a bird with a completely brown back would receive a score of 1 for the back, while a bird with an all-white back would be scored as a 6. The index was later expanded by Pierre Jouventin and colleagues to cover the more complex patterning of the Amsterdam albatross, adding belly and tibial feather colouration. This system for categorising the wide and complex variation in appearance of great albatrosses has been instrumental in the discovery of several genetically isolated populations and consequent description of new taxa, and has made field identification easier. Paragraph 8: John Douglas Gibson John Douglas (Doug) Gibson ( – 21 May 1984) lived in Thirroul, New South Wales all his life, and worked at the nearby Port Kembla steelworks. He was a notable Australian amateur ornithologist who became an internationally respected expert on the Diomedeidae or albatross family. Paragraph 9: Thirroul, New South Wales Thirroul is a northern seaside suburb of the city of Wollongong, Australia. Situated between Austinmer and Bulli, it is approximately 13 kilometres north of Wollongong, and 69 km south of Sydney. It lies between the Pacific Ocean and a section of the Illawarra escarpment known as Lady Fuller Park, adjacent to Bulli Pass Scenic Reserve. Paragraph 10: Too Much Happiness Too Much Happiness is a short story collection by Canadian writer Alice Munro, published on August 25, 2009 by McClelland and Stewart's Douglas Gibson Books imprint.

      "2024-02-15 20:50:08,003 - INFO - Paragraph 1: Premenstrual water retention Premenstrual water retention (or premenstrual fluid retention) is a common phenomenon associated with the menstrual cycle. It consists of the retention of water during the period of time immediately preceding the menstrual cycle (that is, the latter half of the luteal phase, or the week before menstruation). This water retention is most noticeable for its temporary enlargement of the breasts. The excess fluid is lost during menstruation. During this event, the water retention can store enough extra fluid to add an extra 5 – of weight. The phenomenon is thought to be caused by high levels of circulating progesterone, as well as of estrogen and prolactin, stimulating secretory cells in the body and in the breasts. In the breasts, increased blood flow is also thought to be involved. Water retention and breast swelling can also be caused by hormonal contraceptives (which contain estrogen and/or a progestogen). Paragraph 2: Sundowning Sundowning, or sundown syndrome, is a neurological phenomenon associated with increased confusion and restlessness in patients with delirium or some form of dementia. Most commonly associated with Alzheimer's disease, but also found in those with other forms of dementia, the term \"sundowning\" was coined due to the timing of the patient's confusion. For patients with sundowning syndrome, a multitude of behavioral problems begin to occur in the evening or while the sun is setting. Sundowning seems to occur more frequently during the middle stages of Alzheimer's disease and mixed dementia. Patients are generally able to understand that this behavioral pattern is abnormal. Sundowning seems to subside with the progression of a patient's dementia. Research shows that 20–45% of Alzheimer's patients will experience some sort of sundowning confusion. Paragraph 3: Thunderbird (cryptozoology) Thunderbird is a term used in cryptozoology to describe large, bird-like creatures, generally identified with the Thunderbird of Native American tradition. Similar cryptids reported in the Old World are often called Rocs. Thunderbirds are regarded by a small number of researchers as having lizard features like the extinct pterosaurs such as \"Pteranodon\". Reports of Thunderbird sightings go back centuries, and the fossil record does show that giant birds (teratorns) with wingspans between 12 and were likely contemporary with early man. Today the creature is generally regarded as a myth. Paragraph 4: Patagonia picnic table effect The Patagonia picnic table effect (also known as the Patagonia rest area effect or Patagonia rest stop effect) is a phenomenon associated with birding in which an influx of birdwatchers following the discovery of a rare bird at a location results in the discovery of further rare birds at that location, and so on, with the end result being that the locality becomes well known for rare birds, even though in itself it may be little or no better than other similar localities. Paragraph 5: Ice-marginal lava flow An ice marginal lava flow is a phenomenon associated with glaciovolcanism. Glaciovolcanism is the study of volcano and ice interaction, so essentially any and all volcanic activity that interacts with any sort of ice formation The science of glaciovolcanism relatively young in age because, to study it, people must overcome hostile environments. While young, the science of glaciovolcanism can give us clues to in order to reconstruct volcanoes from the past and answer questions regarding whether or not ice was present in a certain area, the thickness of the ice, the surface elevation of the ice sheet and finally the structure of the ice sheet. Glaciovolcanism is increasingly important for volcanic hazard awareness and preparedness, studying the Pleistocene climate record, possible relationships between deglaciation and volcanism, and finally possible Martian geoscience research. Paragraph 6: Separation (statistics) In statistics, separation is a phenomenon associated with models for dichotomous or categorical outcomes, including logistic and probit regression. Separation occurs if the predictor (or a linear combination of some subset of the predictors) is associated with only one outcome value when the predictor is greater than some constant. Paragraph 7: Cold drop The cold drop (Spanish: \"gota fría\" ) is a weather phenomenon often occurring in the Spanish autumn. It is experienced particularly along the western Mediterranean and as such, most frequently affects the east coast of Spain. It is a closed upper-level low which has become completely displaced (cut off) from basic westerly current, and moves independently of that current. Cutoff lows may remain nearly stationary for days, or on occasion may move westward opposite to the prevailing flow aloft (i.e., retrogression). The term is also used to describe the meteorological phenomenon associated. In Spain, it appears when a front of very cold polar air, a jet stream, advances slowly over Western Europe, at high altitude (normally 5–9 km or 3–5.5 mi). Paragraph 8: Bridgewater Triangle The Bridgewater Triangle refers to an area of about 200 mi2 within southeastern Massachusetts in the United States, claimed to be a site of alleged paranormal phenomena, ranging from UFOs to poltergeists, orbs, balls of fire and other spectral phenomena, various bigfoot-like sightings, giant snakes and \"thunderbirds.\" Paragraph 9: Bennington Triangle \"Bennington Triangle\" is a phrase coined by New England author Joseph A. Citro during a public radio broadcast in 1992 to denote an area of southwestern Vermont within which a number of people went missing between 1920 and 1950. This was further popularized in two books, including \"Shadow Child\", in which he devoted chapters to discussion of these disappearances and various items of folklore surrounding the area. According to Citro, the area shares characteristics with the Bridgewater Triangle in neighboring Massachusetts. Paragraph 10: Diffraction in time Diffraction in time is a phenomenon associated with the quantum dynamics of suddenly released matter waves initially confined in a region of space. Q: Bridgewater Triangle is an area where the phenomenon associated with what type of tradition has been seen?A: paranormal\n"

While the text does not explicitly state that she is the most successful female ski racer ever, her record of six overall titles hints at a significant level of success that could arguably put her in contention for that title, particularly considering the era she competed in. Moreover, no other female racer's achievements mentioned in the provided paragraphs explicitly surpass those of Moser-Pröll.\n"

In a 2001 BBC \"Omnibus\" documentary about Elizabeth Taylor, Shirley MacLaine says that Julie Andrews and Lauren Bacall were originally planned to be in the movie. The role of Miriam Hodges was originally offered to June Allyson. Paragraph 3: Us (film) Us is a 1991 television movie broadcast on CBS, produced, written and directed by Michael Landon. Landon also starred in the film, along with Barney Martin and Casey Peterson. It was a pilot for what would have been Landon's fourth consecutive television series; Landon's death that year precluded its going ahead. Landon played Jeff Hayes, a man just released from prison after serving many years due to being wrongfully convicted of killing a wealthy man's wife. Paragraph 4: Anna and the King of Siam (film) Anna and the King of Siam is a 1946 drama film directed by John Cromwell. An adaptation of the 1944 novel of the same name by Margaret Landon, it was based on the fictionalized diaries of Anna Leonowens, an Anglo-Indian woman who claimed to be British and became governess in the Royal Court of Siam (now modern Thailand) during the 1860s. Darryl F. Zanuck read Landon's book in galleys and immediately bought the film rights. Paragraph 5: Mary Elizabeth Bliss Mary Elizabeth \"Betty\" Taylor Bliss Dandridge, born Mary Elizabeth Taylor (April 20, 1824 – July 25, 1909), was the youngest of the three surviving daughters of President Zachary Taylor (1849-1850) and Margaret Mackall Smith Taylor. Paragraph 6: The King and I (1956 film) The King and I is a 1956 American musical film made by 20th Century Fox, directed by Walter Lang and produced by Charles Brackett and Darryl F. Zanuck. The screenplay by Ernest Lehman is based on the Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II musical \"The King and I\", based in turn on the novel \"Anna and the King of Siam\" by Margaret Landon. That novel in turn was based on memoirs written by Anna Leonowens, who became school teacher to the children of King Mongkut of Siam in the early 1860s. Leonowens' stories were autobiographical, although various elements of them have been called into question. The film stars Deborah Kerr and Yul Brynner. Paragraph 7: Krupp Diamond The Elizabeth Taylor Diamond, formerly known as the Krupp Diamond, is a 33.19 carat diamond that was bought by Richard Burton for his wife, Elizabeth Taylor in 1968.

The Krupp diamond was sold by Taylor's estate in 2011 for $8.8 million. Paragraph 8: Margaret Landon Margaret Landon (September 7, 1903 – December 4, 1993) was an American writer best remembered for \"Anna and the King of Siam\", her best-selling 1944 novel of the life of Anna Leonowens which eventually sold over a million copies and was translated into more than twenty languages. In 1950, Landon sold the musical play rights to Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II, who created the musical \"The King and I\" from her book. A later work, \"Never Dies the Dream\", appeared in 1949. Paragraph 9: The King and I The King and I is the fifth musical by the team of composer Richard Rodgers and dramatist Oscar Hammerstein II. It is based on Margaret Landon's novel, \"Anna and the King of Siam\" (1944), which is in turn derived from the memoirs of Anna Leonowens, governess to the children of King Mongkut of Siam in the early 1860s. The musical's plot relates the experiences of Anna, a British schoolteacher hired as part of the King's drive to modernize his country. The relationship between the King and Anna is marked by conflict through much of the piece, as well as by a love to which neither can admit. The musical premiered on March 29, 1951, at Broadway's St. James Theatre. It ran for nearly three years, making it the fourth longest-running Broadway musical in history at the time, and has had many tours and revivals.

      "Takuma Sato is indeed an IndyCar race driver, as mentioned in the first paragraph, and since he drove the Super Aguri SA07 in the 2007 Formula One season, one can infer that an IndyCar race driver (who would become an IndyCar driver later in his career) drove a Formula 1 car designed by Peter McCool in 2007. Therefore, the provided answer of \"2007\" appears to be correct based on the information given. However, the question's phrasing may be somewhat misleading if it suggests that an IndyCar driver, while actively competing in IndyCar, drove the Formula 1 car during the 2007 season.\n",

      "Nonetheless, given that Takuma Sato was a Formula One driver in 2007 and later moved to IndyCar, and that the Super Aguri SA07 was designed by Peter McCool and driven by Sato, it's correct to say that an individual who would be an IndyCar driver drove a Formula 1 car designed by McCool in the 2007 season.\n"

      "2024-02-15 20:51:37,936 - INFO - Paragraph 1: DF-224 The DF-224 is a space-qualified computer used in space missions from the 1980s. It was built by Rockwell Autonetics. As with many spacecraft computers, the design is very redundant, since servicing in space is at best difficult and often impossible. The configuration had three CPUs, one active and two spares. The main memory consisted of six memory units, each with 8K 24-bit words of plated wire memory, with up to 48K words total. Four memory modules could be powered up at one time, resulting in a maximum of 32K words of available memory, though some applications such as the Hubble Space Telescope used fewer memory banks to allow for graceful failure modes. There were three I/O processors, one operational and two backups. The power supply consisted of 6 independent power converters, with overlapping coverage of the operating functions. The processor used fixed-point arithmetic with a two's complement format. Paragraph 2: Dubna 48K The Dubna 48K (Дубна 48К) is a Soviet clone of the ZX Spectrum home computer. It was based on an analogue of the Zilog Z80 microprocessor. Its name comes from Dubna, a town near Moscow where it was produced, and \"48K\" stands for 48 KBs of RAM. Paragraph 3: HP Saturn The Saturn family of 4-bit microprocessors was developed by Hewlett-Packard in the 1980s for programmable scientific calculators/microcomputers. It succeeded the \"Nut\" family of processors used in earlier calculators. The original Saturn chipset was first used in the HP-71B hand-held BASIC-programmable computer, introduced in 1984. Later models of the family powered the popular HP 48 series of calculators, among others. The HP 49 series initially used the Saturn CPU as well, until the NEC fab could no longer manufacture the processor for technical reasons in 2003. Therefore, starting with the HP 49g+ model in 2003, the calculators switched to use a Samsung S3C2410 processor with ARM920T core (part of the ARMv4T architecture) to run an emulator of the Saturn architecture in software. In 2000, the HP 39G and HP 40G were the last calculators introduced based on the Saturn hardware. The last calculators based on the Saturn emulator were the HP 39gs, HP 40gs and HP 50g in 2006, as well as the 2007 revision of the hp 48gII. The HP 50g, the last calculator utilizing this emulator, was discontinued in 2015 when Samsung stopped producing the ARM processor it was based on. Paragraph 4: Nuclotron Nuclotron is the world's first superconductive synchrotron, exploited by the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, Russia. This particle accelerator is based on a miniature iron-shaped field superconductive magnets, and has a particle energy up to 7 GeV. It was built in 1987-1992 as a part of Dubna synchrophasotron modernisation program (the Nuclotron ring follows the outer perimeter of the synchrophasotron ring). 5 runs of about 1400 hours total duration have been provided by the present time. The most important experiments tested the cryomagnetic system of a novel type, and obtained data on nuclear collisions using internal target. Paragraph 5: TEC-1 The TEC-1 is a single-board kit computer first produced by the Australian hobbyist electronics magazine Talking Electronics in the early 1980s. It was based on the Zilog Z80 CPU, had 2K of RAM and 2K of ROM in a default configuration. Later versions used a 4k ROM with two different versions of the monitor software selectable via a switch. This allowed the early software presented in the magazine to be used with the later version of the TEC-1. Paragraph 6: Mugsy (video game) Mugsy is a strategy and management computer game for the 48K ZX Spectrum. It was well-received, mainly due to its innovative graphic style, and was followed two years later by a sequel. Paragraph 7: Space Defender Space Defender is a fixed shooter game for the Apple II computer, created by Daniel Schuyler and published by Bel-Air Software in 1982. It requires an Apple II with a minimum of 48K RAM. Paragraph 8: Knight Tyme Knight Tyme is a computer game released for the ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64 and MSX compatibles in 1986. It was published by Mastertronic as part of their Mastertronic Added Dimension label. Two versions of the ZX Spectrum release were published: a full version for the 128K Spectrum (which was published first) and a cut-down version for the 48K Spectrum that removed the music, some graphics and some locations (which was published later). Paragraph 9: Hareraiser Hareraiser is a computer game, originally released in 1984 in the UK for most home computer platforms. It was released in two parts; \"Prelude\" and \"Finale\".

      "2024-02-15 20:52:35,518 - INFO - Paragraph 1: Race and the War on Drugs The War on Drugs is a term for the actions taken and legislation enacted by the United States government, intended to reduce or eliminate the production, distribution, and use of illicit drugs. The War on Drugs began during the Nixon Administration, with the goal of reducing the supply of and demand for illegal drugs, though an ulterior, racial motivation has been proposed. The War on Drugs has led to controversial legislation and policies, including mandatory minimum penalties and stop-and-frisk searches, which have been suggested to be carried out disproportionately against minorities. The effects of the War on Drugs are contentious, with some suggesting that it has created racial disparities in arrests, prosecutions, imprisonment and rehabilitation. Others have criticized the methodology and conclusions of such studies. In addition to enforcement disparities, some claim that the collateral effects of the War on Drugs have established forms of structural violence, especially for minority communities. Paragraph 2: Drug policy of Slovakia Drug policy of Slovakia is the legislative framework that governs all aspects of legal drugs and illegal drugs on the territory of Slovakia. It was established with the country's creation on 1 January 1993; the Slovak Republic taking over all commitments of the former Czechoslovakia. Both domestic and international law governs the manufacture, sale, transport and use of most drugs. Alcohol is the most used drug in Slovakia, featuring prominently in the Slovak culture. Slovakia consistently ranks among the top alcohol consuming countries in the world. Paragraph 3: Drug abuse in Tanzania Drug abuse is a major issue in Tanzania. In 2011, the drug control commission (which is dealing with drug abuse issues) reported that the number of people who are addicted ranges from 150,000 and 500,000. Most of the people who are involved in drug abuse in Tanzania are youths, who are often involved in trafficking and consuming illegal drugs like cannabis. The common illegal drugs in Tanzania are khat, marijuana, heroin, cocaine, and cannabis. Paragraph 4: Illegal drugs in Puerto Rico Illegal drugs in Puerto Rico are an increasingly significant problem from a criminal, social, and medical perspective, and a large amount of crime in Puerto Rico has been linked to the amount of illegal drugs that flow through the country. Located in the Caribbean, Puerto Rico has become a major transshipment point for drugs into the United States. Violent and property crimes have increased due in part to dealers trying to keep their drug business afloat, using guns and violence to protect themselves, their turfs, and drug habits. Paragraph 5: Illicit drug use in Australia Illicit drug use in Australia is the recreational use of prohibited drugs in Australia. Illicit drugs include illegal drugs (such as cannabis, opiates, and certain types of stimulants), pharmaceutical drugs (such as pain-killers and tranquillisers) when used for non-medical purposes, and other substances used inappropriately (such as inhalants). According to government and community organisations, the use and abuse, and the illegality, of illicit drugs is a social, health and legal issue that creates an annual illegal market estimated to be worth A$ 6.7 billion. Paragraph 6: Illegal drug trade in the Philippines The prevalence of drug use in the Philippines is lower than the global average, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). Two of the most used and valuable illegal drugs in the country are methamphetamine hydrochloride (shabu) and marijuana. Ephedrine and methylenedioxy methamphetamine are also among the list of illegal drugs that are of great concern to the authorities. Paragraph 7: Politics of drug abuse Most countries have legislation designed to criminalise some drug use. Usually however the legislative process is self-referential, defining abuse in terms of what is made illegal. The legislation concerns lists of drugs specified by the legislation. These drugs are often called \"illegal drugs\" but, generally, what is illegal is their unlicensed production, supply and possession. The drugs are also called \"controlled drugs\" or \"controlled substances\". Paragraph 8: Ephedrine Ephedrine is a medication and stimulant. It is often used to prevent low blood pressure during spinal anesthesia. It has also been used for asthma, narcolepsy, and obesity but is not the preferred treatment. It is of unclear benefit in nasal congestion. It can be taken by mouth or by injection into a muscle, vein, or just under the skin. Onset with intravenous use is fast, while injection into a muscle can take 20 minutes, and by mouth can take an hour for effect. When given by injection it lasts about an hour and when taken by mouth it can last up to four hours. Paragraph 9: Drug addiction in Pakistan Drug addiction is defined as compulsive and out-of-control drug use, despite negative consequences. In the last few decades, drug addiction has increased exponentially in Pakistan. Most of the illegal drugs come from the neighbouring Afghanistan. According to the UN estimate, 8.9 million people in the country are drug users. Cannabis is the most used drug. The rate of injection drug abuse has also increased significantly in Pakistan, sparking fears of an HIV epidemic. Paragraph 10: Drug possession Drug possession is the crime of having one or more illegal drugs in one's possession, either for personal use, distribution, sale or otherwise. Illegal drugs fall into different categories and sentences vary depending on the amount, type of drug, circumstances, and jurisdiction. Q: What drug is among the list of illegal drugs in the Philippines and can be taken by mouth or by injection?A: Ephedrine\n"

His reign was marked by aggressive military campaigns and conquest, particularly in the Norse-dominated parts of the British Isles and Ireland, where he extended his rule to the Kingdom of the Isles and Dublin. Paragraph 2: Olaf Magnusson of Norway Olaf Magnusson (1099 – 22 December 1115) was king of Norway 1103–1115. He was the son of King Magnus Barefoot and Sigrid, daughter of Saxe of Vik. Paragraph 3: Battle of Stamford Bridge The Battle of Stamford Bridge took place at the village of Stamford Bridge, East Riding of Yorkshire, in England on 25 September 1066, between an English army under King Harold Godwinson and an invading Norwegian force led by King Harald Hardrada and the English king's brother Tostig Godwinson. After a bloody battle, both Hardrada and Tostig along with most of the Norwegians were killed. Although Harold Godwinson repelled the Norwegian invaders, his army was defeated by the Normans at Hastings less than three weeks later. The battle has traditionally been presented as symbolising the end of the Viking Age, although major Scandinavian campaigns in Britain and Ireland occurred in the following decades, such as those of King Sweyn Estrithson of Denmark in 1069–1070 and King Magnus Barefoot of Norway in 1098 and 1102–1103. Paragraph 4: King Magnus' Halt railway station King Magnus' Halt, sometimes referred to as Magnus' Grave, is the terminal railway station on the Downpatrick & County Down Railway's Southern Line, located in the town of Downpatrick in County Down, Northern Ireland. It takes its name from the nearby grave of Viking King Magnus Barefoot. The grave is a Downpatrick tourist attraction that was not easily accessible prior to the arrival of the railway. It features a platform with lampposts on the East side of the line, which looks onto a field containing the barrow of King Magnus and a runestone which was placed in March 2003 to mark the 900th anniversary of his death. Paragraph 5: Radama I Radama I \"the Great\" (1793–1828) was the first Malagasy sovereign to be recognized as King of Madagascar (1810-1828) by a European state. He came to power at the age of 18 following the death of his father, King Andrianampoinimerina. Under Radama's rule and at his invitation, the first Europeans entered his central highland Kingdom of Imerina and its capital at Antananarivo. Radama encouraged these London Missionary Society envoys to establish schools to teach tradecraft and literacy to nobles and potential military and civil service recruits; they also introduced Christianity and taught literacy using the translated Bible. A wide range of political and social reforms were enacted under his rule, including an end to the international slave trade, which had historically been a key source of wealth and armaments for the Merina monarchy. Through aggressive military campaigns he successfully united two-thirds of the island under his rule. Abuse of alcohol weakened his health and he died prematurely at age 35. He was succeeded by his highest-ranking wife, Ranavalona I. Paragraph 6: Battle of Anglesey Sound The Battle of Anglesey Sound was fought in June or July 1098 on the Menai Strait (\"Anglesey Sound\"), separating the island of Anglesey from mainland Wales. The battle was fought between Magnus Barefoot, King of Norway, and the Anglo-Norman earls Hugh of Montgomery and Hugh d'Avranches, and took place as part of Magnus Barefoot's expedition into the Irish Sea, which sought to assert Norwegian rule over the Kingdom of the Isles. Paragraph 7: Magnus Barefoot Cinema Centre Magnus Barefoot Cinema Centre (Norwegian: \"Magnus Barfot kinosenter\") is a cinema multiplex with 5 screens owned by Bergen Cinema. It is named after the street that runs along the building (however, it is not the address of the complex), which in turned is named after the Norwegian king Magnus Barefoot. It is the main venue of Bergen International Film Festival. Paragraph 8: List of rulers of the Kingdom of the Isles The Kingdom of the Isles comprised the Hebrides, the islands of the Firth of Clyde and the Isle of Man from the 9th to the 13th centuries AD. The islands were known to the Norse as the \"Suðreyjar\", or \"Southern Isles\" as distinct from the \"Norðreyjar\" or Northern Isles of Orkney and Shetland. The historical record is incomplete and the kingdom was probably not a continuous entity throughout the entire period. The islands concerned are sometimes referred to as the \"Kingdom of Mann and the Isles\", although only some of the later rulers claimed that title. At times the rulers were independent of external control, although for much of the period they had overlords in Norway, Ireland, England, Scotland or Orkney. At times there also appear to have been competing claims for all or parts of the territory. The islands involved have a total land area of over 8300 km2 and extend for more than 500 km from north to south.

Paragraph 10: Norman invasion of Wales The Norman invasion of Wales began shortly after the Norman conquest of England under William the Conqueror, who believed England to be his birthright. Initially (1067–1081), the invasion of Wales was not undertaken with the fervor and purpose of the invasion of England. However, a much stronger Norman invasion began in 1081 and by 1094 most of Wales was under the control of William's eldest son, King William II of England. The Welsh greatly disliked the \"gratuitously cruel\" Normans and by 1101 had regained control of the greater part of their country under the long reign of King Gruffudd ap Cynan, who had been imprisoned by the Normans for twelve years before his escape. Gruffudd had some indirect help from King Magnus III of Norway (Magnus Barefoot) who attacked the Normans briefly off the Isle of Anglesey in northwest Wales near Ynys Seiriol, killing Hugh of Montgomery, 2nd Earl of Shrewsbury and leaving the Normans depleted and demoralized. Magnus went on to take the Orkney Islands, the Hebrides, and the Isle of Man, islands north of Wales and west and north of Scotland and England, in 1098.

      "2024-02-15 20:52:47,065 - INFO - Paragraph 1: Bernard's wolf Bernard's wolf (\"Canis lupus bernardi\"), also known as the Banks Island tundra wolf, Banks Island wolf, and the Victoria's Island wolf, was a subspecies of the gray wolf, \"Canis lupus\", that was limited to the Banks and Victoria Island of the Canadian arctic. An extinct subspecies, it was described as \"white with black-tipped hair along the ridge of the back\". It was formally discovered, classified, and named after Peter Bernard and Joseph F. Bernard, his nephew, after an adult male skin and skull was collected by them and brought to the National Museum of Canada. There were very few specimens of this subspecies that were recovered, around three or four in total. A survey was conducted in March 1993 by the Department of Renewable Resources that was to catalog the wolf and caribou populations of the area. While a number of caribou were found and recorded, along with many other indigenous animal species, not a single wolf was found. The Victoria's Island population is believed to have died out in between 1918 and 1952. They were previously widespread in their native habitat but were annihilated by excessive hunting. Paragraph 2: Merriam's elk The Merriam's elk (\"Cervus canadensis merriami\") is an extinct subspecies of elk once found in the arid lands of the southwestern United States, predominantly Arizona. Since the arrival of the Europeans uncontrolled hunting and cattle grazing had driven the subspecies into extinction around the beginning of the 20th century, with the exact presumed date being 1906. Another subspecies of elk, the eastern elk (\"Cervus canadensis canadensis\") also became extinct at roughly the same time. Not much else is known about this subspecies as it became extinct before studies were done. Elk from Yellowstone National Park were introduced to this area in 1913, and are reasonably common in the area today. Paragraph 3: Rhinoceros sondaicus annamiticus Rhinoceros sondaicus annamiticus is an extinct subspecies of \"Rhinoceros sondaicus\", that lived in Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand and Malaysia. The term Annamiticus derives from the Annamite name of the Indochinese Mountains in Indochina, part of the distribution of this species, also known as the Javanese Javan rhinoceros or simply Vietnamese rhinoceros for Vietnam. Only this species, the Stieng called them Pai-mhai once lived across South China, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Malaysia. The subspecific annamiticus is derived from the Annamite Mountain Range in Southeast Asia, part of this subspecies' range. In 2006, a single population, estimated at fewer than 12 remaining rhinos, lived in an area of lowland forest in the Cat Tien National Park in Vietnam. Genetic analysis suggested this subspecies and the Indonesian Javan rhinoceros last shared a common ancestor between 300,000 and 2 million years ago. The last individual of this population was shot by a poacher in 2010. Paragraph 4: Portable art Portable art (sometimes called mobiliary art) refers to the small examples of Prehistoric art that could be carried from place to place, which is especially characteristic of the Art of the Upper Palaeolithic. It is one of the two main categories of Prehistoric art, the other being the immobile Parietal art, effectively synonymous with rock art. Paragraph 5: List of recently extinct plants As of September 2016, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists 116 extinct species, 132 possibly extinct species, 35 extinct in the wild species, 13 possibly extinct in the wild species, five extinct subspecies, one extinct in the wild subspecies, and four extinct varieties of plant. Paragraph 6: Prehistoric art in Scotland Prehistoric art in Scotland is visual art created or found within the modern borders of Scotland, before the departure of the Romans from southern and central Britain in the early fifth century CE, which is usually seen as the beginning of the early historic or Medieval era. There is no clear definition of prehistoric art among scholars and objects that may involve creativity often lack a context that would allow them to be understood. Paragraph 7: List of recently extinct molluscs As of September 2016, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists 310 extinct species, 117 possibly extinct species, 14 extinct in the wild species, eight extinct subspecies, and five extinct in the wild subspecies of mollusc. Paragraph 8: Trogloxene Trogloxenes, also called cave guests, are animal species which live close to caves or at the very entrance of the cave, but cannot live exclusively in a cave. This group consists of both extant animals, such as raccoons, rats, foxes and bears, opiliones (a.k.a. Daddy-Long-Legs) and extinct animals like cave bears, cave lions, cave leopards, and cave hyenas. Indications trusted by geologists and archaeologists combine to show that these animals lived there in the latter part, at least, of the third interglacial epoch, and on through the fourth and last glacial advance, when, although central Europe was free from an ice cap, an almost Arctic climate prevailed, with much rain. This is what is known as the Upper Paleolithic, when humanity in Europe was represented by the Neanderthals. Paragraph 9: List of recently extinct invertebrates As of July 2016, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists 394 extinct species, 206 possibly extinct species, 16 extinct in the wild species, eight extinct subspecies, and five extinct in the wild subspecies of invertebrate. Paragraph 10: Panthera leo spelaea Panthera leo spelaea or P. spelaea, commonly known as the European or Eurasian cave lion, is an extinct subspecies of lion. It is known from fossils and many examples of prehistoric art. Q:  What species has an extinct subspecies that are classified as Trogloxene and are known from fossils and prehistoric art?A: Panthera leo spelaea\n"

Paragraph 8: Lloydieae The Lloydieae were a tribe of monocotyledon perennial, herbaceous mainly bulbous flowering plants in the Liliaceae (Lily) family. The tribe was generally considered monogeric, being represented by the single genus \"Lloydia\". But since that genus has at various times and is now considered to be part of the genus \"Gagea\", and therefore in the \"Lilieae\" tribe, it was sometimes listed with both genera. Furthermore many authorities place \"Gagea\" into a separate tribe, Tulipeae. It has also historically been considered to be a subtribe of the Lilieae. In 2013, Kim \"et al.\" proposed splitting off \"Gagea\" from the rest of Tulipeae by resurrecting the tribe Lloydieae.

      "2024-02-15 20:53:46,754 - INFO - Paragraph 1: William Bainbridge William Bainbridge (May 7, 1774 – July 27, 1833) was a Commodore in the United States Navy. During his long career in the young American Navy he served under six presidents beginning with John Adams and is notable for his many victories at sea. He commanded several famous naval ships, including  and saw service in the Barbary Wars and the War of 1812. Bainbridge was also in command of USS \"Philadelphia\" when she grounded off the shores of Tripoli in North Africa, resulting in his capture and imprisonment for many months. In the latter part of his career he became the U.S. Naval Commissioner. Paragraph 2: USS Bainbridge (CGN-25) USS \"Bainbridge\" (DLGN-25/CGN-25) was a nuclear-powered guided missile cruiser in the United States Navy, the only ship of her class. Named in honor of Commodore William Bainbridge, she was the fourth US Navy ship to bear the name. With her original hull classification symbol of DLGN (nuclear-powered guided missile destroyer leader, called a \"frigate\" at the time), she was the first nuclear-powered destroyer-type ship in the US Navy, and shared her name with the lead ship of the first US Navy destroyer class, the \"Bainbridge\"-class destroyer s. Paragraph 3: Bainbridge County, Mississippi Bainbridge County, Mississippi, was formed by an act of the Mississippi General Assembly dated January 17, 1823 from the western two-thirds of the original Covington County, Mississippi. Its area was almost identical to the modern limits of Covington County, the eastern third of the original county being cut off to form Jones County, Mississippi in 1826, leaving the area of former Bainbridge County as Covington County. The land had been settled from 1811 on by families from the southeastern United States, including a number of free people of color. A state census, \"An account of the increase and decrease of the population of the State of Mississippi in the County of Bainbridge for the year 1823,\" was taken in its first year of existence, but the county was dissolved by an act dated January 21, 1824 and its land returned to Covington County. No reason for its dissolution has been discovered. Though the reason the county was named Bainbridge was not recorded in the creating act, in keeping with naming traditions of that time and place, it was likely named to honor notable U.S. Navy Commodore William Bainbridge. Paragraph 4: USS Bainbridge (DD-246) The third USS \"Bainbridge\" (DD-246) was a \"Clemson\"-class destroyer in the United States Navy during World War II. She was named for Commodore William Bainbridge, who served in the War of 1812 and the First and Second Barbary Wars.

She is the fifth ship to carry that name, and the 46th destroyer of a planned 75-ship class. \"Bainbridge\" is named in honor of Commodore William Bainbridge, who as commander of the frigate USS \"Constitution\" distinguished himself in the War of 1812 when he and his crew captured HMS \"Java\", a 38-gun fifth-rate frigate of the Royal Navy. Paragraph 7: John Adams John Adams (October 30 [O.S. October 19] 1735 – July 4, 1826) was an American patriot who served as the second President of the United States (1797–1801) and the first Vice President (1789–97). He was a lawyer, diplomat, statesman, political theorist, and, as a Founding Father, a leader of the movement for American independence from Great Britain. He was also a dedicated diarist and correspondent, particularly with his wife and closest advisor Abigail. Paragraph 8: Herbert Bainbridge Herbert William Bainbridge (29 October 1862 – 3 March 1940) was an English cricketer and footballer. Bainbridge played cricket principally for Eton, MCC, Surrey, Cambridge University and Warwickshire. He was born at Guwahati, Assam, India and died at Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, England. Paragraph 9: Fort Bainbridge Fort Bainbridge, believed to be named in honor of naval captain William Bainbridge, was a military supply fort located along the Federal Road on what is today the county line between Macon and Russell counties in Alabama. It was either constructed in late 1813 or early 1814 by Georgia troops under the command of Colonel Homer V. Milton or General John B. Floyd in an effort to protect the supply route from Fort Hull to Fort Mitchell. Fort Bainbridge was built in the style of a bastion fort with eight outcroppings. Paragraph 10: USS Bainbridge (DD-1) The second USS \"Bainbridge\" (Destroyer No. 1/DD-1) was the first destroyer, also called \"Torpedo-boat destroyers\", in the United States Navy and the lead ship of the \"Bainbridge\"-class .

Paragraph 7: Bolinao 52 Bolinao 52 is a documentary by Vietnamese American director Duc Nguyen about the Vietnamese boat people ship that was originally stranded in the Pacific Ocean in 1988. During their 37 days at sea, the group encountered violent storms and engine failures. They fought their thirst and hunger and a US Navy ship reportedly refused to rescue them, forcing the boat people to starve despite resorting to cannibalism. Only 52 out of the 110 boat people survived the tragedy and were rescued by Filipino fishermen who brought them to Bolinao Island, Philippines. Paragraph 8: Les Brownlee Romer Leslie \"Les\" Brownlee served as the Undersecretary of the Army from November 2001 to May 2003 and as Acting United States Secretary of the Army from 10 May 2003 until his resignation effective 2 December 2004, staying at the Undersecretary's office.

James Watson Webb as private secretary on his mission to Brazil 1861-63; was commissioner of the Government of the Argentine Republic for the exploration of the Indian country called the Gran Chaco 1863; edited at Buenos Aires a monthly periodical, \"The River Platte Magazine\" (1864); was appointed by President López historiographer of Paraguay; became secretary to Hon. Charles Ames Washburn, U. S. minister to Paraguay, 1866; aided him in collecting materials for his \"History of Paraguay\" (2 vols., 1871); was imprisoned by command of López on a charge of treason and conspiracy for his assassination September 10, 1868; while imprisoned wrote under duress a deliberately falsified account of the U.S. legation's plan, retracted after his rescue by a U. S. Navy squadron December 10, 1868; appointed translator to the State Department at Washington, March, 1869; editor of the \"Washington Chronicle\" 1869-70; President Grant appointed him secretary of legation in Mexico 1870-74, and acting minister several months 1872-73. He afterward resided in New York, and was vice-president of the American Philological Society and an editor of the \"New York Herald\". Died in New York, February 1, 1885. Paragraph 10: Jacob Dolson Cox Jacob Dolson Cox, (Jr.) (October 27, 1828August 4, 1900) was a statesman, lawyer, Union Army general during the American Civil War, and later a Republican politician from Ohio. He served as the 28th Governor of Ohio and as United States Secretary of the Interior. As Governor of Ohio, Cox sided for a time with President Andrew Johnson's Reconstruction plan and was against African American suffrage in the South, though he supported it in Ohio. Seeing himself caught between Johnson and the Radical Republicans, Cox decided not to run for reelection. He stayed out of politics for a year, though both Sherman and Grant advocated that Cox replace Stanton as Secretary of War as a means of stemming the demands for Johnson's impeachment. But Johnson declined. When Ulysses S. Grant became President he nominated Cox Secretary of Interior and Cox immediately accepted. Secretary of Interior Cox implemented the first civil service reform in a federal government department, including examinations for most clerks. Grant initially supported Cox and civil service reform, creating America's first Civil Service Commission. However, Cox was opposed by Republican Party managers, who ultimately convinced Grant to cease civil service reforms. President Grant and Secretary Cox were at odds over the fraudulent McGarahan Claims and the Dominican Republic annexation treaty. Secretary Cox advocated a lasting, honest, and comprehensive Indian policy legislated by Congress after the Piegan Indian massacre. Cox resigned as Secretary of Interior having been unable to gain Grant's support over civil service reform. Although Cox was a reformer, Grant had believed Cox had overstepped his authority as Secretary of Interior and had undermined his authority as President. In 1872 Cox joined the Liberal Republicans in opposition to Grant's renomination. In 1876 Cox returned to politics and was elected to and served one term as United States Congressman of Ohio. Congressman Cox supported President Hayes's reform efforts, but his term as Congressman was unsuccessful at establishing permanent Civil Service reform. Cox retired and did not return to active politics, using his time to write several books on Civil War campaigns which remain today respected histories and memoirs. Q: From what state was the congressman who became Secretary of Defense and reportedly refused to promote Les Brownlee to Secretary of the Army because he was not a CEO?A: Illinois\n"

Karma is a contemporary novel dealing with inner conflicts such as identity, faith with respect to the ritual orthodoxy and customs of the society. The novel thoroughly narrated the difference between Faith and Belief in such a way that each and every character, including the protagonist of the novel get penetrated by that derivation. Details documented about the Hindu death rituals within the story-line are absolute novel writing technique adopted by the writer. The Novel got an immense response from the literature world. Within the year of its release Novel went on with third edition and reached worldwide Kannada readers. Paragraph 2: Lieben lassen Lieben lassen is the erotic romance novel from authors Ariane Sommer and Roman Libbertz. Published in September 2015 it is notable for its explicit erotic scenes and unusual writing technique. The story's narration alternates between the perspectives of the male and the female protagonists. Paragraph 3: Les Champs magnétiques \" Les Champs magnétiques \" \"(The Magnetic Fields)\" is a book by André Breton and Philippe Soupault. It is famed as the first work of literary Surrealism. Published in 1920, the authors used a surrealist automatic writing technique. Paragraph 4: Bob Ong Bob Ong is the pseudonym of a contemporary Filipino author known for using conversational writing technique to create humorous and reflective depictions of Philippine life. The author's actual name and identity is unknown. Paragraph 5: Allison Gross Allison Gross, a hideous witch, tries to bribe the narrator to be her \"leman\". She combed his hair, first. When a scarlet mantle, a silk shirt with pearls, and a golden cup all fail, she blows on a horn three times, making an oath to make him regret it; then she strikes him with a silver wand, turning him into a wyrm (dragon) bound to a tree. His sister Maisry came to him to comb his hair. One day the Seelie Court came by, and a queen stroked him three times, turning him back into his proper form. Paragraph 6: Tybalt Tybalt is the main antagonist in William Shakespeare's play \"Romeo and Juliet\". He is the son of Lady Capulet's brother, Juliet's short-tempered first cousin, and Romeo's rival. Tybalt shares the same name as the character Tibert/Tybalt the \"Prince of Cats\" in \"Reynard the Fox\", a point of mockery in the play. Mercutio repeatedly calls Tybalt \"Prince of Cats\" (perhaps referring not only to Reynard but to the Italian word cazzo as well). Luigi da Porto adapted the story as \"Giulietta e Romeo\" and included it in his \"Historia novellamente ritrovata di due Nobili Amanti\" published in 1530. Da Porto drew on \"Pyramus and Thisbe\" and Giovanni Boccaccio's \"Decameron\". He gave it much of its modern form, including the lovers' names, the rival families of Montecchi and Capuleti, and the location in Verona. He also introduces characters corresponding to Shakespeare's Mercutio, Tybalt, and Paris. Da Porto presents his tale as historically true and claims it took place in the days of Bartolomeo II della Scala (a century earlier than Salernitano). Montague and Capulet were actual 13th-century political factions, but the only connection between them is a mention in Dante's\" Purgatorio\" as an example of civil dissension. Paragraph 7: Rule of three (writing) The rule of three is a writing principle that suggests that events or characters introduced in threes are more humorous, satisfying, or effective in execution of the story and engaging the reader. The reader or audience of this form of text is also thereby more likely to remember the information conveyed. This is because having three entities combines both brevity and rhythm with having the smallest amount of information to create a pattern. It makes the author or speaker appear knowledgeable while being both simple and catchy. Paragraph 8: Article spinning Article spinning is a specific writing technique used in search engine optimization (SEO) and in other applications. Website authors may use article spinning on their own sites to reduce the similarity ratio of rather redundant pages or pages with thin content. Content spinning works by rewriting existing articles, or parts of articles, and replacing specific words, phrases, sentences, or even entire paragraphs with any number of alternate versions to provide a slightly different variation with each spin. This process can be completely automated or written manually. Paragraph 9: Arrow (season 2) The second season of the American television series \"Arrow\" premiered on The CW on October 10, 2013 and concluded on May 14, 2014 with a total of 23 episodes. The series is based on the DC Comics character Green Arrow, a costumed crime-fighter created by Mort Weisinger and George Papp. The showrunners for this season were Greg Berlanti, Marc Guggenheim and Andrew Kreisberg. This season introduces characters from \"The Flash\", which was being developed as a potential spin-off at the time. Paragraph 10: Show, don't tell Show, don't tell is a technique often employed in various kinds of texts to enable the reader to experience the story through action, words, thoughts, senses, and feelings rather than through the author's exposition, summarization, and description. The goal is not to drown the reader in heavy-handed adjectives, but rather to allow readers to interpret significant details in the text. The technique applies equally to nonfiction and all forms of fiction, literature including Haiku and Imagism poetry in particular, speech, movie making, and playwriting. Q: Allison Gross is a character in a story which applies what writing technique that introduces characters in threes? A: Rule\n"

It takes its name from the large number of granite columns that were found on the site and probably once formed part of the ancient agora. The Byzantine castle is believed to have been built at the end of the 7th century AD to protect the port and the city of Nea Pafos from Arab raids and later remodeled by the Lusignans. The Fortress had a three-metre thick wall with four huge corner towers and another four intermediary towers along the joining walls and moat surrounding the castle. Access was across a wooden bridge spanning the moat. The square courtyard measured 35 metres long by 35 metres wide, with a tower at each corner. The main entrance was through a fifth, horseshoe-shaped tower on the east side. Destroyed by an earthquake in 1222, the castle was subsequently abandoned. Paragraph 2: Prizren Fortress Prizren Fortress (Serbian: Призренски град\"/Prizrenski grad\" ), also known as Kaljaja (Albanian: \"Каlаја\" , ) and Dušan's Fortress (Душанов град\"/Dušanov grad\" ), is a medieval fortress in Prizren, Kosovo, which once served as the capital of the Serbian Empire. It was built on a hill above Prizrenska Bistrica, around which the modern city developed. The first fort, erected on this location by the Byzantines, was further expanded by Emperor Stefan Dušan (r. 1331–55). The fort then came under the control of the Ottomans for four centuries. It was declared a Monument of Culture of Exceptional Importance in 1948. Paragraph 3: Prozor Fortress Prozor Fortress (Croatian: \"Tvrđava Prozor\" or \"Gradina\" ) is a medieval fortress situated in the continental part of Split-Dalmatia County, in inland Dalmatia, just above the town of Vrlika in Croatia.

Paragraph 2: Runge–Kutta–Fehlberg method In mathematics, the Runge–Kutta–Fehlberg method (or Fehlberg method) is an algorithm in numerical analysis for the numerical solution of ordinary differential equations. It was developed by the German mathematician Erwin Fehlberg and is based on the large class of Runge–Kutta methods. Paragraph 3: Trefftz method In mathematics, the Trefftz method is a method for the numerical solution of partial differential equations named after the German mathematician Erich Trefftz (1888–1937). It falls within the class of finite element methods. Paragraph 4: Wolfgang Hackbusch Wolfgang Hackbusch (born 24 October 1948 in Westerstede, Lower Saxony) is a German mathematician, known for his pioneering research in multigrid methods and later hierarchical matrices, a concept generalizing the fast multipole method.

Paragraph 5: Martin Wilhelm Kutta Martin Wilhelm Kutta (] ; 3 November 1867 – 25 December 1944) was a German mathematician. Paragraph 6: Runge–Kutta methods In numerical analysis, the Runge–Kutta methods are a family of implicit and explicit iterative methods, which include the well-known routine called the Euler Method, used in temporal discretization for the approximate solutions of ordinary differential equations. These methods were developed around 1900 by the German mathematicians C. Runge and M. W. Kutta. Paragraph 7: Kutta condition The Kutta condition is a principle in steady-flow fluid dynamics, especially aerodynamics, that is applicable to solid bodies with sharp corners, such as the trailing edges of airfoils. It is named for German mathematician and aerodynamicist Martin Wilhelm Kutta. Paragraph 8: Kutta–Joukowski theorem The Kutta–Joukowski theorem is a fundamental theorem of aerodynamics used for the calculation of the lift of an airfoil and any two-dimensional bodies including circular cylinders translating in a uniform fluid at a constant speed large enough so that the flow seen in the body-fixed frame is steady and unseparated. The theorem relates the lift generated by an airfoil to the speed of the airfoil through the fluid, the density of the fluid and the circulation around the airfoil. The circulation is defined as the line integral around a closed loop enclosing the airfoil of the component of the velocity of the fluid tangent to the loop. It is named after the German Martin Wilhelm Kutta and the Russian Nikolai Zhukovsky (or Joukowski) who first developed its key ideas in the early 20th century. Kutta–Joukowski theorem is an inviscid theory, but it is a good approximation for real viscous flow in typical aerodynamic applications.

Paragraph 6: Fox UFC Fox UFC Fight Night (previously referred as Fox UFC Saturday for broadcasts on Fox or FS1 UFC Fight Night for broadcasts on other Fox-owned properties) is the branding used for telecasts of mixed martial art competitions from the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) that are produced by Fox Sports. Previously, \"UFC on Fox\" was also used as a blanket title for UFC events aired on the Fox network, although since the concurrent launch of Fox Sports 1 and rebranding of Fuel TV as Fox Sports 2 in August 2013, all live UFC broadcasts on Fox-owned networks (including preliminaries, \"UFC Fight Night\" and \"The Ultimate Fighter Finale\") have since used the name. Paragraph 7: The Ultimate Fighter 2 The Ultimate Fighter 2 was the second season of the mixed martial arts reality television series \"The Ultimate Fighter\". The season featured a heavyweight and a welterweight division, with 9 fighters initially in each division. The UFC coaches for this season were welterweight and middleweight champions Matt Hughes and Rich Franklin. Season 1 coach and former UFC champion Randy Couture hosted and designed the team challenge segments, which if won would allow the winning team to pair a fighter from their team against another in elimination matches. The finale aired on November 5, 2005, and it set a ratings record for the UFC with a 2.0 overall rating. This season featured no coaches' fight because Hughes and Franklin had refused to fight each other, owing to their friendship. Although released on DVD in 2005, it has been set for re-release on September 18, 2007.

      "2024-02-15 20:56:05,166 - INFO - Paragraph 1: Sweet Crude Sweet Crude is a documentary film by Sandy Cioffi about Nigeria's oil-rich Niger Delta. The film premiered in April 2009 at the Full Frame Documentary Film Festival and has since screened at 30 film festivals around the world and has won numerous awards. Paragraph 2: Sandy Cioffi Sandy Cioffi is a Seattle-based film and video artist. She is director and producer of the documentary film Sweet Crude and has produced and/or directed the films Crocodile Tears, Terminal 187 and Just Us. She is a tenured professor in the Film and Video Communications Department at Seattle Central Community College. Paragraph 3: Pennsylvania Grade Crude Oil Pennsylvania Grade Crude Oil is a type of sweet crude oil (sweet crude oil), found primarily in the Appalachian basin in the Marcellus Formation in the states of New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia, and takes its name for the state of Pennsylvania, where it was first extracted in 1859 from the Drake Well. The area's Pennsylvania Grade Crude Oil has superior qualities and is free of asphaltic constituents, contains only trace amounts of sulfur and nitrogen, and has excellent characteristics for refining into lubricants. The success of drilling for oil at this well led to \"an international search for petroleum, and in many ways eventually changed the way we live.\" There is archaeological evidence that Native Americans harvested \"the oil for medicinal purposes by digging small pits around active seeps and lining them with wood\" at least as far back as 1410 AD. European settlers skimmed the \"oil from the seeps and using the petroleum as a source of lamp fuel and machinery lubrication.\" Paragraph 4: Desert Victory Desert Victory is a 1943 film produced by the British Ministry of Information, documenting the Allies' North African campaign against Field Marshal Erwin Rommel and the Afrika Korps. This documentary traces the struggle between General Erwin Rommel and Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery, from the German's defeat at El Alamein to Tripoli. The film was produced by David MacDonald and directed by Roy Boulting who also directed Tunisian Victory and \"Burma Victory\". Like the famous \"Why We Fight\" series of films by Frank Capra, \"Desert Victory\" relies heavily on captured German newsreel footage. Many of the most famous sequences in the film have been excerpted and appear with frequency in History Channel and A&E productions. The film won a special Academy Award in 1943 and the 1951 film \"\" took sections of the film for its battle footage. Paragraph 5: United States Oil Fund The United States Oil Fund (NYSE Arca: [ USO] ) is an exchange-traded fund that attempts to track the price of West Texas Intermediate Light Sweet Crude Oil. Paragraph 6: Tunisian Victory Tunisian Victory is a 1944 Anglo-American propaganda film about the victories in the North Africa Campaign. Paragraph 7: Oil reserves in Libya Oil reserves in Libya are the largest in Africa and among the ten largest globally with 46.4 Goilbbl as of 2010. Oil production was 1.65 Moilbbl/d as of 2010, giving Libya 77 years of reserves at current production rates if no new reserves were to be found. Libya is considered a highly attractive oil area due to its low cost of oil production (as low as $1 per barrel at some fields in 2002), low sulfur content, being classified as \"sweet crude\" and in its proximity to European markets. Libya's challenge is maintaining production at mature fields, while finding and developing new oil fields. Most of Libya remains under-explored as a result of past sanctions and disagreements with foreign oil companies. Paragraph 8: Gold Coast (region) The Gold Coast is the gold rich region that is now the nation of Ghana on the petroleum sweet crude oil and natural gas rich Gulf of Guinea in West Africa, Africa. Paragraph 9: Sweet crude oil Sweet crude oil is a type of petroleum. The New York Mercantile Exchange designates petroleum with less than 0.42% sulfur as \"sweet\". Petroleum containing higher levels of sulfur is called sour crude oil. Paragraph 10: Enbridge Line 5 Enbridge Line 5 is a major oil pipeline in the Enbridge Lakehead System, which conveys petroleum from western Canada to eastern Canada via the Great Lakes states. Line 5 is particularly notable for passing under the environmentally sensitive Straits of Mackinac, which connect Lake Michigan to Lake Huron. As of December 2013, it is capable of carrying 540,000 oilbbl of oil per day. It carries synthetic crude, natural gas liquids, sweet crude, and light sour crude.

Written in response to the Theatre Royal's rejection of his earlier plays, \"The Author's Farce\" was Fielding's first theatrical success. The Little Theatre allowed Fielding the freedom to experiment, and to alter the traditional comedy genre. The play ran during the early 1730s and was altered for its run starting 21 April 1730 and again in response to the Actor Rebellion of 1733. Throughout its life, the play was coupled with several different plays, including \"The Cheats of Scapin\" and Fielding's \"Tom Thumb\".

The play was first produced by Joan Littlewood's Theatre Workshop and was premiered at the Theatre Royal Stratford East, a small fringe theatre in London, on 27 May 1958. The production then transferred to the larger Wyndham's Theatre in the West End on 10 February 1959. The play was adapted into an award-winning film of the same title in 1961. Paragraph 6: Henry Fielding Henry Fielding (22 April 1707 – 8 October 1754) was an English novelist and dramatist known for his rich, earthy humour and satirical prowess, and as the author of the picaresque novel \"Tom Jones\". Additionally, he holds a significant place in the history of law enforcement, having used his authority as a magistrate to found (with his half-brother John) what some have called London's first police force, the Bow Street Runners.

In addition, Fielding introduces criticism of women and society in general. Paragraph 9: Wisdom of a Fool Wisdom of a Fool is a one-man play based on the early life and career of actor and comedian Norman Wisdom. The play premiered at The Capitol Theatre Horsham in September 2015, which coincided with Wisdom's centenary.

      "2024-02-15 20:56:16,494 - INFO - Paragraph 1: Trekking pole Trekking poles (also known as hiking poles, hiking sticks or walking poles) are a common hiking accessory used to assist walkers with their rhythm and provide stability on rough terrain. Paragraph 2: Holdout (gambling) In gambling jargon, a holdout is any of numerous accessories used by cheats to help them \"hold-out\" a card (or cards) during a card game. Some holdout devices are extremely simple and require moderate or advanced manipulative skill to be used properly. On the other hand, there is a group of holdout devices which are mechanical in nature, therefore they fall under a separate category of holdout machines. Even if those machines are complex mechanical apparatuses, they still require a good level of skill from the cheat's part, to be used well. Paragraph 3: Bench dog A bench dog is an accessory used on a woodworking workbench to allow clamping of wooden items while being worked or planed. Dog in general is something which holds. At its most basic a bench dog is simply a peg which is installed in a corresponding \"dog hole\" in the top of a bench. The holes are arranged in a line perpendicular to the vise, perhaps three or four inches apart but certainly no further apart than the fully open distance between the vise's jaws. Paragraph 4: Hold fast A hold fast is an accessory used on a woodworking workbench and in blacksmithing to fix a workpiece to the top or side of the bench while it is being worked. Paragraph 5: Cocktail strainer A cocktail strainer is a metal bar accessory used to remove ice from a mixed drink as it is poured into the serving glass. A type of sieve, the strainer is placed over the mouth of the glass or shaker in which the beverage was prepared; small holes in the device allow only liquids to pass as the beverage is poured. Paragraph 6: Bench hook A bench hook is a workbench accessory used in woodworking, and its purpose is to provide a stop against which the piece of wood being worked can be firmly held, without having to use the vice, thus saving time. It makes handsawing safer and more accurate. This simple appliance (three sticks of wood) uses the force of the tool and gravity to hold the workpiece and helps guide the tool blade to keep the cuts right on the line. It also allows one to perform with ease (and safety) those cuts that would be terrifying on a power saw and which should be carefully avoided. The bench hook is simply a short wooden board with a batten fixed along the top edge (the stop), with another one—called the hook—astened underneath the bottom at the opposite end (see diagram to the right). The correct practice is to have the stop shorter than the width of base and offset from one edge, thus allowing the saw to complete the cut without scarring the workbench surface. Left handers are obviously obliged to set the stop in reverse. In use the bench hook is laid flat over the bench, with the hook hard up against the front edge of same. With the workpiece thus firmly held against the stop, is easy to see that no clamps or other mechanical fixing are required, the wood being held in place by the combined pressure of the tool (a saw generally) and the hand. Bench hooks are meant to be an aid commonly used with hand tools, such as the backsaw, a hand plane and, somewhat less frequently, a chisel of some kind. Although very simple to make, commercially made bench hooks have become increasingly available. Paragraph 7: Cheating Cheating is the receiving of a reward for ability or finding an easy way out of an unpleasant situation by dishonest means. It is generally used for the breaking of rules to gain unfair advantage in a competitive situation. This broad definition will necessarily include acts of bribery, cronyism, nepotism, sleaze and any situation where individuals are given preference using inappropriate criteria. The rules infringed may be explicit, or they may be from an unwritten code of conduct based on morality, ethics or custom, making the identification of cheating conduct a potentially subjective process. Cheating can refer specifically to marital infidelity. Someone who is known for cheating is referred to as a \"cheat\" in British English, and a \"cheater\" in American English. A person described as a \"cheat\" doesn't necessarily cheat all the time, but rather, relies on unfair tactics to the point of acquiring a reputation for it. Paragraph 8: Spin disk A spin disk is an socket wrench accessory used to quickly turn nuts after they have been loosened with the wrench. Paragraph 9: Astronomical filter An astronomical filter is a telescope accessory used by amateur astronomers to simply enhance the details of celestial objects (much as with amateur photography). By contrast professional astronomers rigorously use filters on telescopes in order to understand the astrophysics (such as stellar classification and placement of a celestial body on its Wien Curve), occurring for the object in a given bandpass via photometry. Paragraph 10: Color scroller A color scroller or color changer is an electro-mechanical lighting accessory used in theater, film, dance and concerts to change the color projected by stage lighting instruments without the need of a person to be in the vicinity of the light. A color scroller moves plastic \"gel\" color gel [actually dyed polyester and/or other base materials coated with dyes] into the beam of the light. It is generally attached to the gel frame holder at the transmitting end of a lighting fixture, so color is introduced after the beam characteristics have been defined by the optics of the lighting instrument. Most scrollers are controlled via DMX512 protocol, but some models (e.g. Wybron's Coloram IT) also utilize the RDM protocol. When color scrollers were first introduced around 1980, a number of companies produced them, including: Avolites, GAM Products, Morpheus Lights, Rainbow, Rosco Laboratories and Wybron Inc. Now the main manufacturers are: A.C. Lighting, Apollo, Morpheus Lights and Rainbow (in alphabetical order).

Antrim, and his wife Letitia Thornton, sister of Lt.-General Sir William Thornton. He came to North America to work in the trading firm of his uncle, Isaac Todd, who was the business partner of James McGill at Montreal. He became a junior partner of the firm and in 1791 was admitted as a member of the Beaver Club. In 1794, the Spanish Governor, Francisco Luis Héctor de Carondelet, granted him an exclusive monopoly over all the trade in Louisiana; highly sought after particularly by Canadians as it was then still separate to the United States. This gave him the exclusive right to the valuable trade on the Upper Mississippi River, the Missouri River and the area north of Ohio. He jealously defended his position and soon became known in the region as \"\"Don Andreas\"\", successfully sending vast stores of goods up from New Orleans while bringing back furs. His uncle's firm back in Montreal, \"Todd, McGill & Co.,\" had found itself in a position to then monopolize the supply of the entire Mississippi Valley, but the declaration of war between Spain and Britain in October 1796, followed by Andrew’s death at New Orleans later that year, dashed their expectations. At his decease, Andrew Todd was unmarried and left no children. By his will, he released his slave, Jack, and left his entire estate to his uncle, Isaac, except for $500 that he left to James McGill, the other executor of his will.

These were precursors to amusement parks. These trolley parks were created by the streetcar companies to give people a reason to use their services on weekends. These parks originally consisted of picnic groves and pavilions, and often held events such as dances, concerts and fireworks. Many eventually added features such as swimming pools, carousels, Ferris wheels, roller coasters, sports fields, boats rides, restaurants and other resort facilities to become amusement parks. Various sources report the existence of between 1,500 and 2,000 amusement parks in the United States by 1919.

Unlike temporary and mobile funfairs and carnivals, amusement parks are stationary and built for long-lasting operation. They are more elaborate than city parks and playgrounds, usually providing attractions that cater to a variety of age groups. While amusement parks often contain themed areas, theme parks place a heavier focus with more intricately-designed themes that revolve around a particular subject or group of subjects.

These amusement parks were especially popular among Singaporeans as it was the locals only form of entertainment, before television or shopping malls were introduced. Gay World Park was an all-in-one complex, where visitors were offered a wide range of entertainment, from movies to shopping and games.

They usually cater to \"sub-regional markets of larger metropolitan areas.\" FECs are generally small compared to full-scale amusement parks, with fewer attractions, a lower per-person per-hour cost to consumers than a traditional amusement park, and not usually major tourist attractions, but sustained by an area customer base. Many are locally owned and operated, although there are a number of chains and franchises in the field. FECs are sometimes called family amusement centers, play zones, family fun centers, or simply fun centers. Some non-traditional FECs, called urban entertainment centers (UECs), with more customized and branded attractions and retail outlets, are associated with major entertainment companies and may be tourist destinations. Others, sometimes operated by Non-Profit organizations as Children's Museums or Science Centers, tend to be geared toward edutainment experiences rather than simply amusement. FECs may also be adjuncts to full-scale amusement parks. Q: Which is a French documentary, The Seine Meets Paris and Great Old Amusement Parks?A: Documentary\n"

It contains an 150-by-300-foot (45,000 square foot) arena floor that can be used not only for sporting events as well as indoor track meets, rodeos and horse shows (most notably the world championship show for the Racking Horse), but also for trade shows, flea markets, and other special events, such as concerts (concert capacity is up to 7,000). One large significance about this arena is that it is the only structure in Alabama that contains a full indoor track. If any school in the state wishes to hold a track meet in the state, this arena is used. It was formerly the site of the Alabama High School Athletic Association State Indoor Track Meet. Concerns over the facility's safety led to the cancellation of the AHSAA Indoor Track season for 2007-2008. Paragraph 6: Videotron Centre The Videotron Centre (French: \"Centre Vidéotron\") is an indoor arena in Quebec City, Quebec, Canada. The 18,259-seat arena replaced Colisée Pepsi as Quebec City's primary venue for indoor events. The new arena is primarily used for ice hockey, serving as the home area of the Quebec Remparts of the QMJHL and has been prospected as a venue for a new or re-located National Hockey League team in Quebec City, and as part of a Winter Olympic Games bid. The building opened on September 8, 2015. It is now the seventh-largest indoor arena in Canada. Paragraph 7: Malmö Arena Malmö Arena is a multi-use indoor arena in Malmö, Sweden, and the home of SHL ice hockey club Malmö Redhawks. It is the largest arena in the SHL, and the second-largest indoor arena in Sweden. Apart from hosting Redhawks hockey matches, the arena is often the venue for team handball, floorball, concerts, and other events. It has also hosted indoor athletics. Owned and operated by Parkfast AB, the arena was designed by Mats Matson of MM Matsson Konsult AB, Hannu Helkiö of Pöyry Architects, and Gert Wingårdh of Wingårdh arkitektkontor. Naming rights for the venue are owned by Malmö Stad, in a ten-year contract, agreed in 2007. Malmö Arena hosted the Eurovision Song Contest 2013 between 14 and 18 May 2013. Paragraph 8: Žalgiris Arena Žalgirio Arena is a multi-purpose indoor arena in the New Town of Kaunas, Lithuania. The arena is located on an island of the Nemunas River. It is the largest indoor arena in the Baltics. The arena's maximum possible seating capacity for basketball games is 15,552, and 20,000 spectators for concerts (when the stage is in the middle, and 17,000 when stage is in the side of the arena). The Žalgiris Arena replaced the Kaunas Sports Hall as a major venue in the city. Paragraph 9: Manchester Arena The Manchester Arena is an indoor arena in Manchester, England, immediately north of the city centre and partly above Manchester Victoria station in air rights space.

      "2024-02-15 20:58:00,367 - INFO - Paragraph 1: Chy Lung v. Freeman Chy Lung v. Freeman, 92 U.S. 275 (1876) was a United States Supreme Court case where the Supreme Court ruled that the power to set rules surrounding immigration, and to manage foreign relations, rested with the United States Federal Government, rather than with the states. The case has been cited in other Supreme Court cases related to government authority on matters relating to immigration policy and immigration enforcement, most recently in \"Arizona v. United States\" (2012). Paragraph 2: Criminal law in the Waite Court During the tenure of Morrison Waite as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States (March 4, 1874 through March 23, 1888), the Supreme Court heard an unprecedented volume and frequency of criminal cases. In just fourteen years, the Court heard 106 criminal cases, almost as many cases as the Supreme Court had heard in the period from its creation to the appointment of Waite as Chief Justice. Notable cases include \"United States v. Cruikshank\" (1875), \"United States v. Reese\" (1875), \"Reynolds v. United States\" (1878), \"Wilkerson v. Utah\" (1879), the \"Trade-Mark Cases\" (1879), \"Strauder v. West Virginia\" (1880), \"Pace v. Alabama\" (1883), \"United States v. Harris\" (1883), \"Ex parte Crow Dog\" (1883), \"Hurtado v. California\" (1884), \"Clawson v. United States\" (1885), \"Yick Wo v. Hopkins\" (1886), \"United States v. Kagama\" (1886), \"Ker v. Illinois\" (1886), and \"Mugler v. Kansas\" (1887). Paragraph 3: Legal Tender Cases The Legal Tender Cases were a series of United States Supreme Court cases in the latter part of the nineteenth century that affirmed the constitutionality of paper money. In the 1869 case of \"Hepburn v. Griswold\", the Court had held that declaring paper notes to be legal tender in payment of debts existing prior to the Legal Tender Act of 1862 violated the United States Constitution. In the \"Legal Tender Cases\", the Court overruled \"Hepburn\", beginning with \"Knox v. Lee\" and \"Parker v. Davis\" in 1871, and then \"Juilliard v. Greenman\" in 1884. Paragraph 4: Hollingsworth v. Perry Hollingsworth v. Perry refers to a series of United States federal court cases that legalized same-sex marriage in the State of California. The case began in 2009 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, which found that banning same-sex marriage violates equal protection under the law. This decision overturned ballot initiative Proposition 8, which had banned same-sex marriage. After the State of California refused to defend Proposition 8, the official sponsors of Proposition 8 intervened and appealed to the Supreme Court. The case was litigated during the governorships of both Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jerry Brown, and was thus known as Perry v. Schwarzenegger and Perry v. Brown, respectively. As \"Hollingsworth v. Perry\", it eventually reached the United States Supreme Court, which held that, in line with prior precedent, the official sponsors of a ballot initiative measure did not have Article III standing to appeal an adverse federal court ruling when the state refused to do so. Paragraph 5: Stephen Halbrook Stephen P. Halbrook is a Senior Fellow at the Independent Institute and an author and lawyer known for his litigation on behalf of the National Rifle Association. He has written extensively about the original meanings of the Second Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment (the latter as applied to Second Amendment rights). He has argued and won three cases before the US Supreme Court: \"Printz v. United States\", \"United States v. Thompson-Center Arms Company\", and \"Castillo v. United States\". He has also written briefs in many other cases, including the Supreme Court cases \"Small v. United States\" (pertaining to the Gun Control Act of 1968) and \"McDonald v. Chicago\". In \"District of Columbia v. Heller\", he wrote a brief on behalf of the majority of both houses of Congress. More broadly, his decades of research on the Second Amendment contributed to the intellectual foundation of the \"Heller\" decision. He has written many books and articles on the topic of gun control, some of which have been cited in Supreme Court opinions (\"Heller\", \"McDonald\", \"Printz v. United States\"). He has testified before congress on multiple occasions. Halbrook’s most important scholarly contribution, however, was the book \"That Every Man Be Armed\", originally published in 1986. The book was the most thorough analysis of the legal history and original intent of the Second Amendment. Paragraph 6: Arizona v. United States Arizona v. United States, 567 U.S. ___ (2012) , was a United States Supreme Court case involving Arizona's S.B. 1070, a state law intended to increase the powers of local law enforcement who wished to enforce federal immigration laws. At issue is whether the law usurps the federal government's authority to regulate immigration laws and enforcement. The Court ruled that sections 3, 5(C), and 6 of S. B. 1070 were preempted by federal law, but left other parts of the law intact, including a provision that allowed law enforcement to investigate a person's immigration status. Paragraph 7: List of United States state supreme court cases Every year, each of the 50 United States state supreme courts decides hundreds of cases. Of those cases dealing with state law, a few significantly shape or re-shape the law of their state or are so influential that they later become models for decisions of other states or the federal government, or are noted for being rejected by other jurisdictions. The same is true of those cases involving a federal question, except that these may be appealed to the United States Supreme Court. This list contains notable final decisions of these courts – those that were not subject to appeal, or from which no appeal was taken, or from which an appeal was taken but certiorari was denied. Appealed decisions that are notable primarily because of later actions of the U.S. Supreme Court covered in the listings of U.S. Supreme Court cases. The decisions are listed in chronological order. Paragraph 8: Arizona v. California Arizona v. California is a set of United States Supreme Court cases, all dealing with disputes over water distribution from the Colorado River between the states of Arizona and California. It also covers the amount of water that the State of Nevada receives from the river as well. Paragraph 9: Reynolds v. United States Reynolds v. United States, 98 U.S. (8 Otto.) 145 (1878), was a Supreme Court of the United States case that held that religious duty was not a defense to a criminal indictment. \"Reynolds\" was the first Supreme Court opinion to address the Impartial Jury and the Confrontation Clauses of the Sixth Amendment. Paragraph 10: Evans v. Jordan Evans v. Jordan, 13 U.S. 199 (1815) , was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that someone who had copied a patented invention after the patent had expired, and before the patent was restored by a private bill, would be liable for damages for patent infringement for any use continuing after the patent was restored. It was the second published Supreme Court decision on patent law, and the first of four Supreme Court cases dealing with the Oliver Evans flour mill patent. Like other Supreme Court patent cases prior to \"Evans v. Eaton\", however, this case did not deal with substantive patent law, but only with issues of statutory construction and infringement liability. Q: Are both Arizona v. United States and Reynolds v. United States Supreme Court cases?A: Yes.\n"

      "2024-02-15 20:58:03,884 - INFO - Paragraph 1: Battle of Arausio The Battle of Arausio took place on 6 October 105 BC, at a site between the town of Arausio (modern day Orange, Vaucluse) and the Rhône River. Ranged against the migratory tribes of the Cimbri under Boiorix and the Teutoni were two Roman armies, commanded by the proconsul Quintus Servilius Caepio and consul Gnaeus Mallius Maximus. However, bitter differences between the commanders prevented the Roman armies from cooperating, with devastating results. The terrible defeat gave Gaius Marius the opportunity to come to the fore and radically reform the organization and recruitment of Roman legions. Roman losses are described as being up to 80,000 troops, as well as another 40,000 auxiliary troops (allies) and servants and camp followers — virtually all of their participants in the battle. In numbers of losses, this battle is regarded as the worst defeat in the history of ancient Rome. Paragraph 2: Battle of Tara (Ireland) The Battle of Tara was fought between the Gaelic Irish of Meath, led by Máel Sechnaill mac Domnaill, and the Norse Vikings of Dublin, led by Amlaíb Cuarán. It took place near the Hill of Tara in Ireland in the year 980. The battle was a devastating defeat for the Vikings and led to the Irish regaining control of Dublin. Paragraph 3: Battle of Byeokjegwan The Battle of Byeokjegwan (or Pyŏkje) (Chinese: 碧蹄館大戰; \"Bì tí guǎn dàzhàn\") was a battle fought on January 27, 1593 (January 26 according to the Japanese calendar of the time), between the armies of the Ming Dynasty led by Li Rusong, and the Japanese forces under Tachibana Muneshige, Ukita Hideie, and Kobayakawa Takakage. As part of the Japanese Invasion of Korea (Imjin War), it was the first field battle fought during the war between the two sides. Paragraph 4: Max Hoffmann Carl Adolf Maximilian Hoffmann (25 January 1869 – 8 July 1927) was a German military strategist. As a staff officer at the beginning of World War I, he was Chief of Staff of the 8th Army. Hoffmann, along with Hindenburg and Ludendorff, masterminded the devastating defeat of the Russian armies at Tannenberg and the Masurian Lakes. He then held the position of Chief of Staff of the Eastern Front. At the end of 1917, he negotiated with Russia to sign the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. In 1922, he tried to set up an anti-Soviet coalition without success. Paragraph 5: Battle of Svensksund The Battle of Svensksund (Finnish: \"Ruotsinsalmi\", Russian: \"Rochensalm\") was a naval battle fought in the Gulf of Finland outside the present day city of Kotka on 9 and 10 July 1790. The Swedish naval forces dealt the Russian fleet a devastating defeat that resulted in an end to the Russo-Swedish War of 1788–90. The battle is the biggest Swedish naval victory and the largest naval battle ever in the Baltic Sea. Paragraph 6: Battle of Tannenberg The Battle of Tannenberg was fought between Russia and Germany from 26–30 August 1914, during the first month of World War I. The battle resulted in the almost complete destruction of the Russian Second Army and the suicide of its commanding general, Alexander Samsonov. A series of follow-up battles (First Masurian Lakes) destroyed most of the First Army as well and kept the Russians off balance until the spring of 1915. The battle is particularly notable for fast rail movements by the Germans, enabling them to concentrate against each of the two Russian armies in turn, and also for the failure of the Russians to encode their radio messages. It brought considerable prestige to Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg and his rising staff-officer Erich Ludendorff. Paragraph 7: Operation Michael Operation \"Michael\" was a major German military offensive during the First World War that began the Spring Offensive on 21 March 1918. It was launched from the Hindenburg Line, in the vicinity of Saint-Quentin, France. Its goal was to break through the Allied (Entente) lines and advance in a north-westerly direction to seize the Channel ports, which supplied the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) and to drive the BEF into the sea. Two days later General Ludendorff, the Chief of the German General Staff, changed his plan and pushed for an offensive due west, along the whole of the British front north of the River Somme. This was designed to separate the French and British Armies and crush the British forces by pushing them into the sea. The offensive ended at Villers-Bretonneux, to the east of the Allied communications centre at Amiens, where the Allies managed to halt the German advance; the German Armies had suffered many casualties and were unable to maintain supplies to the advancing troops. Paragraph 8: Battle of Anholt The Battle of Anholt (25–27 March 1811) occurred during the Gunboat War, a war between the United Kingdom and Denmark-Norway. It was an attempt by the Danes to recapture Anholt, a small Danish island off the coast of Jutland, which the British had captured in 1809. The Danish army had a larger fighting force than the British, but a lack of planning and supply failures led to a devastating defeat and many Danish casualties. After the battle, the British occupation of Anholt continued until the peace treaty in 1814. There is a monument commemorating the battle in Anholt village. Paragraph 9: First Battle of the Marne The Battle of the Marne (French: Première bataille de la Marne , also known as the Miracle of the Marne, \"Le Miracle de la Marne\") was a World War I battle fought from 6–10 September 1914. It resulted in an Allied victory against the German armies in the west. The battle was the culmination of the German advance into France and pursuit of the Allied armies which followed the Battle of the Frontiers in August and had reached the eastern outskirts of Paris. A counter-attack by six French armies and the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) along the Marne River forced the Imperial German Army to retreat north-west, leading to the First Battle of the Aisne and the Race to the Sea. The battle was a victory for the Allies but led to four years of trench warfare stalemate on the Western Front. Paragraph 10: Polish–Soviet War in 1919 In 1918, the German Army in the east was the most powerful force in the region. Even more importantly, it was not only undefeated, it was victorious (in contrast to the German Army on the western front). However the commander of the German forces in the east, Max Hoffmann, a chief negotiator in the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, was facing increasing difficulties. He believed, rightly, that his army was the only stabilising influence over the Eastern Europe. Yet with the disintegration of Austria-Hungary, rise of Bolsheviks in the east and various independent governments between the former frontline and Germany, the former \"Oberkommando-Ostfront\" (or \"Ober-Ost\") occupation zone became a thin line to nowhere, connected only to still-German Prussia. The deteriorating situation in Germany, facing the threat of civil war, eventually forced Hoffman to begin to retreat westwards, to Germany, in December 1918. Demoralized officers and mutinous soldiers abandoned their garrisons \"en masse\" and returned home. Only a limited number of units still retained any combat strength. Q: Max Hoffmann along with Hindenburg and Ludendorff, masterminded the devastating defeat of the Russian armies in a battle fought when ?A: Tannenberg\n"

It is the official provincial mammal of British Columbia. It is noted for about one-tenth of its population having white or cream-coloured coats like polar bears. This colour is due to a double recessive gene unique in the subspecies. They are not albinos and not any more related to polar bears or the \"blonde\" brown bears of Alaska's \"ABC Islands\" than other members of their species. Sometimes, a mother black bear can have a white cub. Paragraph 2: Wapusk National Park Wapusk National Park is Canada's 37th national park, established in 1996. The park is located in the Hudson Plains ecozone, 45 km south of Churchill in north-east Manitoba, Canada, on the shores of Hudson Bay. Access to the park is limited due to its remote location and an effort to preserve the park. The name comes from the Cree word for polar bear (\"wâpask\"). The Park is also home to Cape Churchill, which is renowned as the best location in the world to view and photograph wild polar bears. The only way people can access Cape Churchill is by helicopter or Tundra Buggy. Paragraph 3: Armie Hammer Armand Douglas \"Armie\" Hammer (born August 28, 1986) is an American actor.

      "The question seems to be asking about the precursor to the Apple Magic Mouse and Apple Mighty Mouse, which refers to the type of mouse Apple sold with their computers 22 years before the Apple Mighty Mouse was introduced in 2005. Therefore, the correct answer would be a one-button mouse that Apple sold beginning with the Apple Lisa computer. The Apple Lisa itself was not a mouse but a personal computer introduced by Apple. Hence, the predecessor mentioned would be the one-button mouse Apple provided with the Lisa, not the Lisa computer itself.\n"

His maternal great grandfather was the philanthropist Don Manuel Carrillo Tablas, who served as mayor of Orizaba, Veracruz, Mexico many times.

Pratt, was an American settler, businessman, public servant and diplomat of the Kingdom of Hawaii. He married Elizabeth Kekaʻaniau Laʻanui, a member of the Hawaiian nobility, and defended her claims to the Hawaiian crown lands during the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii. Paragraph 4: Prachethasa Prachetasa is considered to be one of the most mysterious figures of Hindu mythology. It is an epithet for Varuna the god of water and its principle and as such are related to ‘shatabhoisag’ asterism. According to the puranas Prachetasa was one of the 10 Prajapatis who were ancient sages and law gives. But there is also a reference to 10 Prachetas who were sons of Prachinabarthis and great grandsons of Prithu. It is said that they lived for 10,000 years in a great ocean, very deeply engaged in meditation upon Vishnu and obtained from Him the boon of becoming the progenitors of mankind. They married a girl named Manisha, a daughter of Kanclu . Daksha was their son. But according to another version it is said that Prajapathi Daksha an ancient sage and contemporary of Lord Shiva, gave his 27 daughters in marriage to Soma ( Chandra). Soma was born from Marichi. But it is also said that Daksha was also the son of a woman called Marichi. Marichi is again referred to as the mother of Daksha.

      "2024-02-15 21:00:10,869 - INFO - Paragraph 1: Suzanne Simone Baptiste Louverture Suzanne Simone Baptiste Louverture (around 1742 – May 19, 1816 in Agen, France) was the wife of Toussaint Louverture and the \"Dame-Consort\" of the French colony of Saint-Domingue. Paragraph 2: War of Knives The War of Knives (French: \"Guerre des couteaux\"), also known as the War of the South, was a civil war from June 1799 to July 1800 between the Haitian revolutionary Toussaint Louverture, a black ex-slave who controlled the north of Saint-Domingue (modern-day Haiti), and his adversary André Rigaud, a free colored person of mixed race who controlled the south. Louverture and Rigaud fought over de facto control of the French colony of Saint-Domingue during the war, which took place after the two men had successfully expelled foreign forces from the colony as part of the Haitian Revolution. The war resulted in Toussaint taking control of the entirety of Saint-Domingue, and Rigaud fleeing into exile. Paragraph 3: Jean Baptiste Brunet Jean Baptiste Brunet (7 July 1763 – 21 September 1824) was a French general of division in the French Revolutionary Army. He was responsible for the arrest of Toussaint Louverture. He was promoted to command a light infantry demi-brigade at the Fleurus in 1794. He led the unit in François Joseph Lefebvre's division in the 1795, 1796 and 1799 campaigns. He was the son of French general Gaspard Jean-Baptiste Brunet who was guillotined in 1793. Paragraph 4: Toussaint L'Overture County Cemetery The Toussaint L'Ouverture County Cemetery is an historical African-American cemetery located in Franklin, Tennessee. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. It is named for Toussaint Louverture, the leader of the Haitian Revolution. The earliest recorded burials date from 1869, but it wasn't officially incorporated until 1884. It is \"the oldest African American institution in continuous use\" in Williamson County. Paragraph 5: Sanité Bélair Suzanne Bélair, called \"Sanité Bélair\", (1781 – 5 October 1802), was a Haitian Freedom fighter and revolutionary, lieutenant in the army of Toussaint Louverture. Paragraph 6: Toussaint Louverture François-Dominique Toussaint Louverture (] 20 May 1743 – 7 April 1803), also known as Toussaint L'Ouverture or Toussaint Bréda, was the best-known leader of the Haitian Revolution. His military and political acumen saved the gains of the first Black insurrection in November 1791. He first fought for the Spanish against the French; then for France against Spain and Great Britain; and finally, for Saint-Domingue against Napoleonic France. He then helped transform the insurgency into a revolutionary movement, which by 1800 had turned Saint-Domingue, the most prosperous slave colony of the time, into the first free colonial society to have explicitly rejected race as the basis of social ranking. Paragraph 7: Revolution (Nina Simone song) \"Revolution\" is a 1969 song by American jazz musician Nina Simone and Weldon Irvine. It was released as a single in 1969 and on the album \"To Love Somebody\" in 1969. The single release was split over two sides of a 45 rpm disc and these two edits were used as separate tracks on the album. The song was released the year after the Beatles' \"Revolution\", and is seen by some as a variation of that song. \"Revolution\" didn't do as well as expected and Simone has expressed surprise and disappointment at its lack of success. Paragraph 8: Simone Torres Simone Torres arrives in the fictional town of Pine Valley, Pennsylvania in 2001 at the behest of Edmund Grey in order to aid his brother-in-law Mateo Santos uncover the identity of the drug lord \"Proteus\". An investigative reporter, Simone works to find Proteus's true identity while pretending to be engaged in an affair with Mateo, in order to protect the latter's wife and son from Proteus's wrath. Simone falls in love with Mateo, but it is clear his heart lies with his wife Hayley. Simone mistakenly believes that a legitimate book publisher is interested in her authoring a book on the investigation. Revealing inside information to the publisher, Simone is shocked when it turns out to be a front set up by \"Vanessa Cortlandt\", the real Proteus. As a result of Simone's leak, FBI agent \"Chris Stamp\" is almost killed. A furious Mateo distances himself from Simone. Paragraph 9: United States and the Haitian Revolution The Haitian Revolution provoked mixed reactions in the United States. In June 1793 when the Haitian people, led by Toussaint Louverture, overthrew the French colonial rule and declared themselves an independent colony, it made the neighboring United States uneasy. The slaves in Saint-Domingue’s were able to observe the growing disunity among the white colonists and themselves. They realized that they would need to seek an opportunity to stop the tyranny that was being placed upon them, thus they took a stand and revolted. The Haitian Revolution of 1804 impacted the United States of America, led by Thomas Jefferson, instilling fear of racial instability in the US, and the possible problematic effect the revolution could have on the early foreign relations and trade between the US and the new independent Haiti. Thomas Jefferson realized that the Haitian Revolution had the potential to cause an upheaval against slavery in the US not only by the slaves themselves, but by white abolitionists as well. Southern slaveholders feared that the revolt might spread from the island of Hispaniola to the slave plantations of the Southern United States. The primary goal of the US was to maintain social order in the country, so the United States attempted to suppress the Haitian Revolution. The US even went as far as to refuse acknowledgement of Haitian independence until 1862, which was during the heat of the North American civil war; coincidentally the main causal factor for the war between the states was slavery. The second major impact that the Haitian Revolution had on the United States was on early foreign relations and trade that had been conducted with Haiti. The United States had conducted trade and commerce with the Haitian island under French rule during the eighteenth century. Haiti was the main producer of the United States supply of sugar and coffee, and once the Haitian slave population had broken from slavery, the US was reluctant to continue trade with them in fear that they would upset the French and the Southern slaveholders. American merchants conducted a substantial trade with the plantations on Hispaniola (aka the French colony of Saint Domingue or Haiti). But there were anti-slavery advocates in northern cities who believed that consistency with the principles of the American Revolution — life, liberty and equality for all—demanded that the U.S. support the slave insurgents. An extremely beneficial aspect and real estate triumph that resulted from the Haitian Revolution and impacted the United States was the Louisiana Purchase. Once Napoleon had lost his control of the land holding in the Caribbean to the Haitian rebellion, he felt that the French territory in the southern part of the United States was useless to the French Empire. The US was only interested in the New Orleans area; however, the revolution enabled the sale of the entire territory west of the Mississippi River for around $15 million. This purchase more than doubled the United States’ territory. Paragraph 10: Joseph Saint-Rémy Joseph Saint-Rémy (1818 - 1856) was a Haitian historian. He is best known for his biography \"La Vie de Toussaint Louverture\" about the Haitian Revolution leader Toussaint L'Ouverture, and for his work \"Pétion et Haïti\", about another Revolutionary figure, Alexandre Pétion. Born in Guadeloupe, Saint-Rémy emigrated to Haiti as a young child and grew up in Les Cayes before leaving for school in France. Q: Suzanne Simone Baptiste Louverture is the wife of the leader of which revolution?A: Haitian\n"

Peter McCool was mentioned in the context of designing the Super Aguri SA07, which was the Formula One car for the 2007 season, driven by Takuma Sato and Anthony Davidson.\\n\\nTakuma Sato is indeed an IndyCar race driver, as mentioned in the first paragraph, and since he drove the Super Aguri SA07 in the 2007 Formula One season, one can infer that an IndyCar race driver (who would become an IndyCar driver later in his career) drove a Formula 1 car designed by Peter McCool in 2007. Therefore, the provided answer of \"2007\" appears to be correct based on the information given. However, the question\\'s phrasing may be somewhat misleading if it suggests that an IndyCar driver, while actively competing in IndyCar, drove the Formula 1 car during the 2007 season.\\n\\nNonetheless, given that Takuma Sato was a Formula One driver in 2007 and later moved to IndyCar, and that the Super Aguri SA07 was designed by Peter McCool and driven by Sato, it\\'s correct to say that an individual who would be an IndyCar driver drove a Formula 1 car designed by McCool in the 2007 season.', 'TRUE\\n\\nFrom Paragraph 9, we know that \"Ghost Rider\" is a song by the protopunk band Suicide appearing on their debut album, and the song is based on the Marvel Comics character.

He played the hot-tempered younger brother of the woman\\'s fiancé.\\n\\nIn Paragraph 5, it\\'s mentioned that Nicolas Cage starred in various films, including \"Red Rock West\" in 1993. Therefore, the male star of \"Moonstruck,\" Nicolas Cage, also starred in \"Red Rock West\" in the year 1993, making the statement TRUE.\\n\\nTherefore, the answer \"Red Rock West\" to the question is correct, and my initial indication of FALSE was incorrect. The answer should be TRUE.', 'TRUE\\n\\nAdventist World is a monthly international magazine of the Seventh-day Adventist Church with editors based in Silver Spring, Maryland, and Seoul, Korea, indicating that it has an international presence.

If \"scope of profession\" refers to the diversity of roles within the film industry, Delmer Daves has indeed worked as a screenwriter, director, and producer as indicated in the paragraphs.
